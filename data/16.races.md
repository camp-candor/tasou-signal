## Chapter 3: The Blood in the Ink - The Kin of the Sunken World

Before you choose the story to be written on your skin, you must first understand the canvas. In the Sunken World, one does not simply choose a race. One inherits a legacy, a burden, and a beautiful, terrible curse. The different peoples of this land are not defined by simple biology, but by the nature of their Primal Mark, the quality of their Chorus, and their ancestral relationship to the slow, creeping rot of the Fading.

What follows are the six great Kin-groups, the primary bloodlines from which a player character can hail. Remember, these are not mere collections of traits and abilities. They are entry points into the grand, tragic opera of the Sunken World. Each is a unique flavor of decay, a different kind of ghost story waiting to be told. The question is not *what* you are, but what weight of history you carry, and whether you will bear it with grace or be crushed beneath it.

### The River-Folk: The Gilded Lie

*“They say our blood is as old and proud as the great river itself. They forget that the river is mostly mud, and it drowns more than it gives life.”*
- **Lady Evangeline deSoto, after refusing her third suitor.**

**What the World Knows:** To be of the River-Folk is to be human, and to be human is to rule. They are the Gilded Families in their decaying manors and the common folk in their dusty towns. They are the architects of the current age, the masters of the social order, and the most fervent practitioners of the noble lie of Anchoring. Their Heirlooms are said to be the purest, their lineages the most meticulously recorded, their Primal Marks the most balanced. They see themselves as the steadfast heart of the world, the civilizing force against the encroaching swamp and the creeping Fading.

**The Inked Truth:** The River-Folk are defined by a profound and terrified hypocrisy. Their entire society is built on the belief that they are preserving the world, while in truth, their ravenous appetite for Anchoring is what accelerates its demise. Their obsession with lineage is not about pride, but about a deep-seated fear of mediocrity, a terror of being forgotten by a world that is already forgetting itself. Their Chorus is a cacophony of social climbers, disgraced duelists, pious hypocrites, and iron-willed matriarchs, each whispering conflicting advice on honor, duty, and the ruthless acquisition of power. To be human is to be caught in a web of your own making, forced to smile at a garden party while the ghosts of your family scream in your blood.

**Marks of the Kin:** The River-Folk are as varied as any human population. Their distinction lies in the perfection and artistry of their Heirlooms. A Gilded Family member’s skin is a flawless canvas of mythic beasts, historical scenes, and intricate sigils, each line perfect, each color vibrant. The common folk bear simpler, more practical tattoos, but the style is recognizably human—a blend of the classical and the baroque.

**Playing a River-Folk Character:** You are the default, the standard by which all others are judged, and this is both a privilege and a prison. You are likely entangled in a web of family obligations, rivalries, and dark secrets. Your personal quest is often a rebellion against this suffocating heritage or a desperate attempt to live up to its impossible standards. You are a natural leader, a charming rogue, a scheming politician, or a devout priest of a faith you may not even believe in.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Fighter (Battle Master), Paladin (Oath of Devotion or Vengeance), Rogue (Mastermind or Swashbuckler), Warlock (The Great Old One, representing a pact with a truly ancient ancestor), Wizard.

### The Cypress Kin: The Patient Rot

*“The Gilded build their houses of stone to keep the world out. We build our homes on the water to feel the world breathe. It is a dying breath, to be sure. But it is honest.”*
- **Silas-of-the-Bog, Murk-Elf Poleman.**

**What the World Knows:** In the deepest, most primeval swamps, where the cypress knees look like the grasping hands of drowned men, live the Murk-Elves. The River-Folk see them as reclusive, uncanny, and unsettlingly patient. They are unnaturally long-lived, their lifespans stretching across centuries, making them living repositories of a time before the Fading was so advanced. They move with a silent, languid grace, poling their skiffs through winding bayous, their eyes holding the deep, sorrowful wisdom of the ancient world.

**The Inked Truth:** The longevity of the Cypress Kin is their greatest curse. In a world where the Heirloom consumes the self, a long life is a guarantee of erasure. The eldest among them are little more than beautiful, breathing statues, their minds entirely consumed by a Chorus that stretches back to the dawn of the world. They are not patient; they are paralyzed by the weight of a million memories. Their connection to nature is a symptom of this decay; as their own identity fades, they become more like the ancient, unthinking swamp itself—slow, silent, and occasionally, terrifyingly dangerous. Their Chorus is not a collection of voices, but a deep, sorrowful hum, the collective sigh of a people who have watched everything they ever loved turn to grey.

**Marks of the Kin:** The Cypress Kin are tall and willowy, with skin that often has the pale, greenish tint of lichen or the smooth, grey texture of water-logged wood. Their eyes are dark and wide, and they move with an unnerving stillness. Their Heirlooms are not inked, but *grown*. They cultivate symbiotic, phosphorescent fungi and magical lichens on their skin, which form intricate, glowing patterns that shift and writhe in the gloom of the swamp.

**Playing a Cypress Kin Character:** You are an old soul, regardless of your age. You have seen more of the world’s sorrow than most, and you carry it with a quiet, melancholic grace. Your story is likely one of flight—fleeing the slow, inevitable erasure of your people, seeking a way to preserve your own identity against the tide of centuries. You might be a keeper of lost lore, a silent hunter, a weaver of subtle illusions, or a grim warden of the swamp’s darkest secrets.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Druid (Circle of the Spore or Swamp), Ranger (Gloom Stalker), Rogue (Scout), Monk (Way of Shadow), Warlock (Archfey).

### The Geodes: The Unmoving Heart

*“The River-Folk write their lies on their skin. We bear the truth in our bones. Stone does not lie. It simply endures. Or it breaks.”*
- **Breccia, Hearth-Dwarf and Myth-Weaver.**

**What the World Knows:** Descended from the Scions of the Mountain-Shred, the Geodes are the dwarves of the Sunken World. They dwell in the rolling, ancient hills and half-buried, quarry-towns at the edges of the Faded Lands. They are seen as stubborn, traditional, and taciturn, masters of stonework and the true artisans of the Myth-Weaver’s craft. Where a human artist seeks beauty, a Geode seeks permanence. They are the anchors of society, their promises as solid as the stone they carve.

**The Inked Truth:** The Geodes’ strength is their prison. Their Primal Mark binds them to the earth, making them physically and ideologically unmoving. They are bound by tradition to a fault, their society crippled by an inability to adapt to the changing, Fading world. Their Chorus is a monolithic, rumbling chant of unbreakable oaths and unforgiven grudges. A Geode does not just remember their grandfather’s duel with a rival clan; they feel the sting of the insult as if it were their own. Their famous stoicism is a necessary defense against a constant, seismic pressure of ancestral obligation. To be a Geode is to be a living mountain, magnificent and mighty, but also isolated and incapable of moving from your designated place in the world.

**Marks of the Kin:** Geodes are stout and broad, with a solidity that seems to defy gravity. Their skin has a stone-like texture, ranging from the smoothness of marble to the rough grit of sandstone, and often features naturally occurring crystalline patterns. Their Heirlooms are masterpieces of geometric precision, carved or branded into their skin rather than inked. These tattoos resemble arcane schematics or intricate architectural blueprints, glowing with a dull, internal heat.

**Playing a Geode Character:** You are a creature of principle and tradition. Your word is your bond, and your grudges are eternal. Your personal journey will likely involve a conflict between your deeply ingrained traditions and a world that demands you change. Are you a staunch defender of the old ways, or a radical who believes your people’s stubbornness will be their doom? You are a peerless artisan, an unshakeable warrior, or a historian who bears the weight of your people’s long, unyielding memory.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Artificer (Armorer or Battle Smith), Barbarian (Path of the Totem Warrior, flavored as ancestors), Cleric (Forge or Order Domain), Fighter (Champion), Paladin (Oath of the Crown).

### The Silt-Folk: The Secret Keepers

*“The Gilded Lords look down on us from their balconies. They see rats on a river. They never think to ask why the rats always know which ship is sinking first.”*
- **Mama Posy, Silt-Folk Matriarch.**

**What the World Knows:** The halflings of the Sunken World are the Silt-Folk, the ubiquitous and often-overlooked people of the great river’s delta. They live in sprawling shanty-towns of houseboats or serve as the domestic staff in Gilded Manors. They are seen as simple, clannish, and cheerful in the face of hardship. They are the cooks, the servants, the smugglers, and the storytellers, always present but rarely noticed.

**The Inked Truth:** The Silt-Folk are the ultimate survivors, and their cheerful demeanor is a well-honed mask. Their unassuming nature makes them invisible, allowing them to navigate the treacherous currents of the Sunken World’s society. They are the keepers of secrets; the servant who overhears a treasonous plot, the smuggler who knows the Gilded Lord’s secret vice. Their Heirloom is unique. Instead of a Chorus of powerful, individualistic ancestors, they have the "Chorus of the Commons"—a collective, whispering memory of the community itself. Their power comes not from singular heroes, but from the combined resilience, cunning, and folk-wisdom of generations of survivors. To be a Silt-Folk is to be one small, vital part of a much larger whole, your identity buffered by the shared story of your people.

**Marks of the Kin:** The Silt-Folk are small and nimble, with weathered skin and watchful eyes. Their Heirlooms are not grand works of art, but patchworks of smaller tattoos. They look like a sailor’s logs, a collection of symbols, charms, and pictograms, each one representing a shared story, a useful skill, or a communal memory. These tattoos are often done in simple, homemade inks and are constantly being added to.

**Playing a Silt-Folk Character:** You are underestimated, and that is your greatest strength. You have a fierce loyalty to your community and a deep-seated distrust of the powerful. Your story is likely one of protecting your own, using your wits and your uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time to navigate a world that sees you as insignificant. You are a cunning rogue, a charismatic storyteller, a surprisingly resilient brawler, or a folk-healer whose magic is as much about comfort as it is about cures.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Bard (College of Eloquence), Fighter (Thief or Assassin), Monk (Way of the Drunken Master), Ranger (Swarmkeeper, flavored as community spirits), Warlock (Pact of the Talisman).

### The Ash-Branded: The Caged Fury

*“My grandfather was a hero. My great-grandfather was a monster. The trick is learning which voice to listen to when the blood starts to sing.”*
- **Kaelen, Scourged Kin Outcast.**

**What the World Knows:** Where the Faded Lands turn to cracked, ashen plains, live the Scourged Kin, the orcs of the Sunken World. Society shuns them as violent brutes, living reminders of the world’s savagery. Their history is one of blood and rage, their Heirlooms a gallery of monsters and madmen. They live in isolated, hard-scrabble tribes, bound by strict codes of honor designed to keep the explosive violence of their own lineage in check.

**The Inked Truth:** The Ash-Branded are locked in a perpetual war with themselves. Their Chorus is not a collection of whispers; it is a screaming mob of the most violent, rage-filled, and monstrous ancestors. While other Kin struggle to keep their identities from fading, the Ash-Branded fight every day to keep their ancestors from taking complete control. Their infamous rage is a defensive mechanism, an explosion of personal will to silence the Chorus, but it is a dangerous and often self-destructive tactic. To be of the Scourged Kin is to walk a razor’s edge, your every moment a struggle for self-control against a tide of inherited fury. They are not evil; they are a people atoning for sins they did not commit.

**Marks of the Kin:** The Ash-Branded are powerfully built, their skin often grey or mottled, as if stained by soot. They often feature prominent tusks, horns, or sharpened teeth. Their Heirlooms are brutal and raw, often incorporating scarification and ritual brands. The tattoos depict monstrous beasts, scenes of epic violence, and chaotic, angry-looking runes, the ink a stark black against their ashen skin.

**Playing an Ash-Branded Character:** You are an outsider, judged by the sins of your ancestors. Your story is a profound struggle for redemption and self-mastery. Do you embrace the power of your violent Chorus to protect those you care about, knowing you risk losing yourself to it? Or do you seek a path of peace, a way to silence the ghosts of your bloodline forever? You are a mighty warrior, a tormented shaman, or a grim survivor who has learned to channel your inner fury into an unbreakable will.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Barbarian (Path of the Berserker or Zealot), Fighter (Brute), Druid (Circle of the Moon, focusing on monstrous forms), Paladin (Oath of Redemption), Warlock (The Fiend, representing the most monstrous ancestor).

### The Wyrm-Blooded: The Corrosive Pride

*“We are descended from a dragon. It gives us a certain… clarity. We know what we want, and we know that the world exists to give it to us. It is a simple, elegant truth.”*
- **Lucien St. Clair, a Scale-Gilded Scion.**

**What the World Knows:** The rarest and perhaps most feared of the great Kin, the Wyrm-Blooded are the dragonborn of the Sunken World. They are not a separate people, but rather an ancient and exclusive bloodline of the River-Folk, their lineage forever altered by a pact or union with a true dragon in the distant past. They are the epitome of the Gilded aristocracy—impossibly wealthy, arrogant, and possessed of a terrifying, singular power.

**The Inked Truth:** The Wyrm-Blooded Heirloom is a tyrant. Unlike the diverse Chorus of other Kin, their lineage is dominated by a single, overwhelming voice: the ancient dragon founder. This draconic ancestor’s consciousness is so powerful that it almost entirely silences all others. This grants the Wyrm-Blooded incredible, focused power, but it also erodes their humanity at an alarming rate. They are consumed by the primal draconic urges of their founder: greed, pride, possessiveness, and a cold, reptilian cruelty. Their personal struggle is not against a crowd of ghosts, but against a single, magnificent, and utterly monstrous god in their blood.

**Marks of the Kin:** The Wyrm-Blooded look mostly human, but with uncanny, draconic tells. Their eyes might have slitted pupils; they might have patches of fine, iridescent scales on their neck, hands, or shoulders; their voices may carry an unnaturally deep resonance. Their Heirlooms are always dominated by a single, magnificent draconic motif, often inked in metallic, shimmering pigments that seem to shift color in the light.

**Playing a Wyrm-Blooded Character:** You were born with immense power and crushing expectation. Your story is about the corrosive nature of pride and the struggle to find empathy in a soul dominated by a monster’s greed. Do you embrace your draconic heritage, seeking to become a true dragon in human form? Or do you fight against it, a desperate battle to nurture the last embers of your own humanity? You are a terrifying sorcerer, a charismatic but ruthless leader, or a fallen noble trying to escape the golden cage of your own blood.

*   **Suggested Classes:** Sorcerer (Draconic Bloodline), Paladin (Oath of Conquest), Bard (College of Glamour), Warlock (The Fathomless, flavored as a primordial swamp dragon or leviathan), Fighter (Cavalier, befitting a noble).
