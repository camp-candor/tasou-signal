Of course. Let us now ascend from the scarred Ashen Plains to the highest peaks of the Sunken World’s society. Here, in the rarefied air of the Gilded City’s spires and the opulent decay of their mountain-top Roosts, we find the most magnificent, most powerful, and most tragically inhuman of all the Kin: the Wyrm-Blooded.

## Chapter 3.6: The Wyrm-Blooded - The Corrosive Pride

*“My great-grandmother loved a man. A commoner. She had him perfectly preserved in amber, so that his beauty would never fade and he would never disappoint her. We still keep him in the west gallery. It was, I believe, the most romantic gesture in our family’s history. It is a testament to the purity of our affections.”*
- **Lord Cassian St. Clair, explaining his lineage’s view on love.**

Above all other Kin, there are the Wyrm-Blooded. They are not merely another branch on the great, tangled tree of humanity; they are, in their own minds, a different species entirely. A graft of divine, draconic fire onto the mundane rootstock of mankind. They are the dragonborn of this world, but not a distinct race of lizard-folk. They are a bloodline, an infection of greatness, a Gilded Family of the River-Folk whose founder, ages ago, made a pact with, was cursed by, or perhaps even loved, a true dragon. The result is a lineage that has replaced the chaotic, gossiping Chorus of their human ancestors with the single, overwhelming, and tyrannical voice of the Wyrm.

To the wider world, they are the pinnacle of the Gilded aristocracy. Their wealth is legendary, their power absolute, and their pride as vast and ancient as the mountains they favor for their homes. Their every gesture is one of languid, condescending grace. They are the beautiful, terrible apex predators of a society built on lies. And this is the great, corrosive irony of their existence: they believe their pride is a sign of their divine strength, but it is, in fact, the symptom of a metaphysical disease that is slowly and inexorably devouring their souls.

To play a Wyrm-Blooded is to wrestle with a god in your own blood. It is to walk a world of lesser beings while a voice in your head whispers of your own manifest destiny. It is a story of magnificent, terrifying solitude, and the desperate, often doomed, search for a single flicker of human warmth in a heart that is slowly turning to gold and stone.

### The Tyrant in the Blood: The Singular Chorus

The soul of a Wyrm-Blooded is not a crowded room; it is a throne room, and the throne is occupied by a single, magnificent tyrant. Their Chorus is not a collection of voices. It is a singular, resonant, and overwhelming consciousness—the soul-fragment of the **Progenitor Dragon** that first infected their bloodline. All other ancestral voices are silenced, suppressed, or utterly consumed by its sheer, ancient power. A Wyrm-Blooded does not hear the whispers of their human grandmother; they feel the cold, possessive certainty of a creature that measures its life in epochs.

This Singular Chorus does not offer advice; it imposes instinct. The Progenitor Dragon’s consciousness is a constant, subliminal pressure that remakes its host in its own image. It replaces the complex, contradictory emotions of humanity with the three great, simple truths of dragonkind:

1.  **Dominance:** The world is a hierarchy, and you are its apex. All other creatures are either vassals, threats, or insignificant scenery. Social interaction is not about connection; it is a constant, subtle negotiation of dominance.
2.  **Possession:** That which is beautiful, valuable, or powerful must be owned. It must be brought into your Hoard, where it can be protected, admired, and controlled. This applies to gold, to art, to land, and most disturbingly, to people. Love, to a Wyrm-Blooded, is often indistinguishable from a desire for ownership.
3.  **Pride:** You are a reflection of a perfect, ancient being. Your every action must be a testament to that perfection. Weakness, doubt, and humility are not just failings; they are a form of blasphemy against the god in your own blood.

This is the Corrosive Pride. It is a spiritual acid that dissolves empathy, erodes compassion, and leaves behind a magnificent, but monstrous, solipsism. The internal struggle of a Wyrm-Blooded is not against a crowd of ghosts, but against a single, indomitable will that is actively rewriting their personality to suit its own ancient, inhuman desires.

### The Living Regalia: An Heirloom of Molten Gold

A Wyrm-Blooded’s Heirloom is a direct manifestation of their draconic nature. They do not trust the common, grubby Marrow-Inks of other Kin. Their tattoos, their **"Regalia,"** are crafted from precious metals and crushed gemstones, fused directly to their skin by a Myth-Weaver who must be as much a master jeweler as a tattooist.

The Regalia is not a picture of a dragon; it is the *essence* of the dragon made manifest. Swirls of molten gold might trace the path of a breath weapon, fine scales of platinum might shimmer on their shoulders and cheekbones, and their family sigil might be rendered in crushed rubies over their heart. These tattoos are not static. They gleam with a faint, internal light, the metals seeming to flow like liquid beneath their skin. They are warm to the touch, a constant, low-grade fever that marks the draconic fire within.

The Regalia is the antenna for the Singular Chorus. The more extensive and pure the metals on their skin, the clearer the voice of the Progenitor Dragon becomes, and the faster their humanity erodes. This leads to the most bizarre and grotesque of their traditions: **The Molting.**

A Wyrm-Blooded does not simply add to their tattoos. As they grow in power and their connection to the Dragon deepens, their existing Regalia will begin to dull and crack. Over the course of a week of fever and pain, the old tattoos will flake away from their skin in a shower of precious metal dust, revealing a new, more glorious and complex pattern that has grown in its place. It is a process of sloughing off a lesser self—and another layer of their humanity—to reveal a more perfect, draconic form.

### A Society of Solitary Peaks: The Way of the Roost

Wyrm-Blooded society is not a community; it is a collection of rival dragons pretending to be a family. They do not live together in cities, but in isolated, fortified **"Roosts"**—opulent manors built on mountain peaks, unassailable spires in the Gilded City, or moated fortress-estates in the deepest part of the swamp. A Roost is a dragon’s lair, a defensible fortress from which they look down upon their territory.

**The Hoard:** The heart of every Roost is the Hoard. A Wyrm-Blooded’s Hoard is not just a treasury; it is the external manifestation of their soul. It contains not only gold and jewels, but art, historical artifacts, Anchored memories stolen from lesser families, and sometimes, even people. A prized artisan, a beautiful consort, or a rival’s heir might be kept in luxurious captivity, a living jewel in the Wyrm-Blooded’s collection. To a Wyrm-Blooded, the size and quality of their Hoard is a direct measure of their worth. To steal from a Wyrm-Blooded’s Hoard is not just theft; it is an act of spiritual violation that will be met with apocalyptic fury.

**The Draconian Compact:** The only thing that prevents the endlessly ambitious Wyrm-Blooded from destroying each other is a fragile, ancient truce known as the Draconian Compact. It is a complex set of rules for their cold war, allowing for rivalry, corporate espionage, and social sabotage, but forbidding open warfare and the assassination of a Roost’s acknowledged heir. This turns their political landscape into a deadly, multi-generational game of chess, where the pieces are economies, secrets, and the lives of lesser Kin.

**The Blighted:** The greatest fear of any Wyrm-Blooded is to be found unworthy by the Progenitor Dragon in their blood. This can happen through a great humiliation, an act of perceived weakness, or a failure to protect the Hoard. When this happens, the Dragon’s voice recedes, and the Wyrm-Blooded undergoes a reverse Molting. Their Regalia tarnishes, the scales flake away leaving behind ugly, discolored scars, and their power fades. They become **"The Blighted."** To their family, they are a walking embodiment of shame. They are stripped of their name and cast out, forced to live as outcasts, a fate most consider worse than death.

### Playing a Wyrm-Blooded Character

To play a Wyrm-Blooded is to embrace a character of immense power and profound internal conflict. You are a titan in a world of mortals, but that power is actively trying to turn you into a monster. Your story is about the struggle to find or preserve your humanity against the crushing weight of your own magnificent pride.

*   **The Gilded Prisoner:** You are the heir to a powerful Roost, your life a carefully orchestrated path to power. Your Regalia is magnificent, the voice of the Dragon is strong, and you are destined for greatness. But a part of you, a small, terrified flicker of your human self, is screaming. You have seen the cold emptiness in your parents’ eyes and fear the same fate. Your adventure is a secret rebellion, a search for a way to quiet the Dragon without becoming Blighted.

*   **The Blighted Exile:** You were once a prince, but you have been cast down. You are Blighted, your power gone, your skin scarred, your name a curse. Your quest is one of desperate survival and impossible redemption. Do you seek to regain the Dragon’s favor, no matter the cost? Or do you embrace your newfound humanity, finding a different kind of strength in the world you once looked down upon? You may be the only Wyrm-Blooded who is truly free.

*   **The Hoard-Breaker:** A strange empathy has taken root in your soul, a flaw in your draconic programming. You have come to see the objects and people in your family’s Hoard not as possessions, but as prisoners. You have become a thief in your own house, secretly liberating artifacts, memories, and even people from your family’s clutches. You are a heretic against the very nature of your blood, a Robin Hood of a soul, hunted by your own Kin who see your compassion as a terrifying mental illness.

*   **The Perfect Scion:** You do not fight the Dragon; you embrace it. You see your humanity not as something to be preserved, but as a final impurity to be burned away. Your goal is apotheosis. You seek to become the Progenitor Dragon reborn, to silence the last vestiges of your human conscience and achieve a state of perfect, monstrous clarity. Your story is a dark descent, a villain’s journey, and a terrifying exploration of what it means to willingly become a god, even if that god is a monster.

### Wyrm-Blooded Traits

Your Wyrm-Blooded character is a scion of the River-Folk, forever altered by a draconic pact. You have the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

**Age.** The draconic fire in their blood causes the Wyrm-Blooded to mature slightly faster and live significantly longer than their human cousins. They reach adulthood at 16 and can live for nearly two centuries.

**Alignment.** The relentless, selfish pressure of the Progenitor Dragon pushes the Wyrm-Blooded toward lawful evil. Their belief in their own superiority and a rigid hierarchical order is paramount. A good or chaotic Wyrm-Blooded is a profound anomaly, likely at war with their own soul.

**Size.** Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Living Regalia.** Your skin is fused with precious metals that form your Heirloom. You have a natural armor bonus. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

**Corrosive Pride.** The tyrannical will of the Progenitor Dragon in your blood makes you difficult to sway. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Draconic Breath.** You can use your action to exhale a burst of destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

**Lineage.** All Wyrm-Blooded carry the same curse, but it manifests in subtly different ways, dictated by the nature of their Progenitor Dragon. Choose one of the following draconic lineages:

#### Tyrant Sun (Gold Dragon)
Your ancestor was a dragon of fire and arrogant nobility. Your Regalia is a masterpiece of shimmering gold, and your pride is as blinding as the sun.

*   **Damage Type:** Fire
*   **Breath Weapon:** 15-foot cone (Dexterity save)
*   **Hoard’s Gleam.** You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.

#### Bayou Leviathan (Black Dragon)
Your ancestor was a creature of the deep swamp, a dragon of acid and corrosive spite. Your Regalia is a dark, oily pattern of tarnished silver and obsidian.

*   **Damage Type:** Acid
*   **Breath Weapon:** 5 by 30-foot line (Dexterity save)
*   **Venomous Words.** You have proficiency in the Deception skill.

#### Mountain-Heart (Silver Dragon)
Your ancestor was a dragon of the frozen peaks, a creature of ice and stern, cold judgment. Your Regalia is a starkly beautiful design of platinum and diamond-dust.

*   **Damage Type:** Cold
*   **Breath Weapon:** 15-foot cone (Constitution save)
*   **Voice of Command.** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

Choose your lineage. Will you be the golden tyrant, the venomous diplomat, or the cold-hearted judge? It matters little. You are Wyrm-Blooded. The world is your treasure chest, and its people are the jewels you will collect. Your soul is the price you have already paid for the privilege. Do try to look down on the rest of us with an appropriate measure of pity. It is the only kindness you have left.
