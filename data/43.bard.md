Alright, let's pull up a creaking chair on this dusty porch, pour a finger of something that burns, and talk about the truth. Not the Gilded truth they polish up in the manors, and not the deep, muddy truth the swamp-folk whisper about. I'm talking about the truth you find at the bottom of a bottle, in the last verse of a sad old song, the kind of truth that's got a little blood and a little bourbon mixed in it.

Let's talk about the Bard.

***

## Chapter 3.2: The Bard - The Man in Black

*“They asked me, ‘Son, why do you only sing the sad songs? Why do you sing of the sinners and the ghosts, the lost causes and the broken things?’ I looked ‘em in the eye and said, ‘Because the happy songs are for the folks who ain’t been payin’ attention.’ In this here Sunken World, the only honest story is a ghost story. The only honest note is a blue one. My job ain't to make you feel good. It's to make you feel* true*. And the truth, friend, the truth ain't ever been pretty.”*
- **An old Story-Spinner, tuning a guitar with a skull inlaid on the headstock.**

Forget the prancing minstrels in their silken clothes, the jesters in the Gilded courts. They are a lie, a sweet bit of candy to cover the taste of the rot. The true Bard of the Sunken World is a different animal altogether. They are the keeper of the Weary Truth, the connoisseur of the Hollow Epics. They are the Man in Black at the wedding feast, the one who knows the groom’s secrets and the bride’s sorrows, and has the guts to sing about them both.

The Bard is the ultimate historian in a world that is actively trying to forget its own history. While the Myth-Weaver is the scholar, poring over the dry genealogy of the blood, the Bard is the journalist, the muckraker, the one who walks the dusty roads and the muddy bayous to find the stories that don't make it into the family histories. They are the ones who know that the great hero of the Moreau family was a drunkard and a cheat, and that the sainted matriarch of the St. Clairs had a secret lover among the Silt-Folk.

Their tragedy is not the loss of self, like the Barbarian, or the slow fade of the Murk-Elf. The Bard's tragedy is that they *remember*. They remember it all—the glory and the shame, the love and the betrayal, the beautiful lie and the ugly truth. And they are cursed with the need to sing about it. They are the conscience of the Sunken World, and in a place built on polite fictions, the conscience is a lonely and a dangerous thing to be.

### The Honest Chorus: The Power of the True Story

The Bard’s magic is the power of narrative itself. It is the understanding that a well-told story, a true story, has a weight that can bend reality. Their relationship with their Chorus is unique. They are not its vessel, like the Cleric, nor at war with it, like the Barbarian. They are its editor, its curator, and its grim biographer. They listen to the gossiping, lying, and self-aggrandizing ghosts in their blood, and their great art is to sift through the noise to find the one, true, heartbreaking note.

Their spellcasting is an act of journalistic magic, of weaponized truth.

*   **Verbal Components:** Are not just the names of ancestors, but the damning details. To cast *Charm Person*, a Bard might not just invoke a charming ancestor, but whisper, “I know a story about your great-uncle and a certain game of cards in the Delta…”
*   **Somatic Components:** Are the gestures of a master storyteller. They are the tracing of a tattoo that depicts not a glorious battle, but a shameful retreat. They are the strum of a guitar, the mournful cry of a harmonica, the rhythmic stomp of a dusty boot on a hollow wooden floor.
*   **Material Components:** Are their Reliquary of truths. A bit of yellowed newspaper from a forgotten scandal. A pressed, faded flower from a secret lover's grave. A rusty key to a room where a terrible secret was kept.

### The Bard's Tools: An Arsenal of Sorrow and Truth

The Bard’s abilities are the tools of their trade, the instruments they use to pry open the coffin of the past and make its ghosts sing.

*   **Bardic Inspiration:** Is not a simple boon of courage. It is a whispered secret, a shared, sorrowful truth that gives a moment of grim clarity. You might grant your Fighter ally inspiration by murmuring, "Your grandfather felt this same fear at the Battle of the Ashen Bridge. He held the line. Don't you dare shame his ghost." It is a gift of strength, but it is a heavy gift.
*   **Song of Rest:** Is a sad, old song sung in a low, quiet voice. It is a dirge for the lost, a lullaby for the damned. It does not just heal the body; it soothes the soul by reminding it that its own sorrow is not unique, that it is just another verse in the great, sad song of the world.
*   **Jack of All Trades:** Comes from a life spent in the back rooms, the dusty libraries, and the muddy crossroads. You've had to learn a little bit of everything to survive, to know enough of a man's trade to know when he's lying to you.
*   **Expertise:** You are an expert not just in a skill, but in the stories *behind* that skill. Your expertise in History isn't just knowing dates; it's knowing the secret, scandalous history that the Gilded Families have tried to erase. Your expertise in Persuasion isn't just being charming; it's knowing the precise, personal story that will break a person’s heart and bend their will.

### Creating a Bard

When you create a Bard, you are creating a keeper of uncomfortable truths. You are a sinner who sings of saints, and a saint who sings of sinners. You walk a lonely road, your only companions the ghosts of your own stories. Ask yourself:

*   **What is the great, true story you are compelled to tell?** Is it a personal tragedy—the story of your own lost love, your own family’s shame? Or is it a greater truth—the secret of the Gilded Lie, the hypocrisy of the Sepulcher School, the weariness of the world itself?
*   **What is your instrument?** Is it a battered, six-string guitar, its wood stained with whiskey and tears? A mournful harmonica that sounds like a ghost on the wind? Or is it just your own voice, rough and honest and true, honed in a thousand dusty taverns and roadside camps?
*   **Why do you walk the road?** Are you running from a truth you can’t bear to face? Are you hunting for a story that has been lost, a final verse that will make sense of all the sorrow? Or are you simply a collector, a connoisseur of heartbreak, forever seeking a new, sadder song to sing?

### Bard Colleges: The Pulpits of the Truth

At 3rd level, a Bard chooses their College. This is not a school, but a pulpit. It is the method by which they have chosen to preach their particular gospel of the Weary Truth.

#### College of the Hollow Epic

You are the classic Story-Spinner, the historian of the heart’s forgotten battlefields. You have dedicated yourself to the art of the Hollow Epic, the belief that the only complete story is a tragic one. You are the one who sings not just of the hero’s victory, but of the price he paid, the memory he lost, the quiet, lonely years that followed. You are a master of lore, a keeper of the full, unedited truth of the world’s decaying soul.

**Bonus Proficiencies**
When you join the College of the Hollow Epic at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in three skills of your choice, representing your broad and tireless collection of stories from every walk of life.

**Cutting Words**
Also at 3rd level, you learn to use your knowledge of a person's story against them. You learn to weaponize their own past, their own failures, their own secret shames. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, roll a Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.
*   **The Weave:** This is not a simple distraction. It is a whispered, personal, and devastating truth. As the Gilded Duellist lunges, you might murmur, just loud enough for him to hear, "Your father used that same lunge. It's how he lost his eye." You are not just distracting him; you are reminding him of his own inherited history of failure.

**Additional Magical Secrets**
At 6th level, you have collected stories of every kind of power. You learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.

**Peerless Skill**
Starting at 14th level, your belief in the power of a complete story, flaws and all, has become a form of magic in itself. When you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

#### College of the Grave-Dirt Gospel

You have walked the Faded Lands, you have sat in the Weeping Boneyard, and you have learned a truth that is deeper and darker than any Gilded lie: the dead are not silent. They sing. Their music is the rustle of the kudzu, the groan of the sinking tombstone, the whisper of the grave-soil. You are a Bard of the Grave-Dirt Gospel, a heretic who has learned to harmonize not with the Chorus of your blood, but with the great, sorrowful Chorus of the land itself. Your music is a thing of the Green Rot, a sermon preached in the language of decay.

**Bonus Proficiencies**
When you join the College of the Grave-Dirt Gospel at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in medium armor and with the herbalism kit. Your connection to the Loam-Whisper gives you a resilience that other Bards lack.

**Sermon of the Rot**
Also at 3rd level, you learn to preach the gospel of decay. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. They count as bard cantrips for you, but they don’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know.

**Un-Weaving Melody**
Starting at 6th level, you can use your music to temporarily unravel the Heirlooms of others, reminding their ghosts of the inevitable decay to which all things must return. As an action, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to begin playing a discordant, atonal melody. Choose a creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you that can hear you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
On a failed save, the target’s connection to its Chorus is frayed. For the next minute, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and whenever it casts a spell, it must first succeed on a concentration check as if it had taken damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**The Land Remembers**
At 14th level, your connection to the Loam-Whisper has become absolute. The land itself is your ally and your archive. You can cast *speak with plants* at will. Additionally, when you are in the wilderness, you can use your action to ask the land a single question about a specific event that occurred in your location within the last week. The land will answer you with a fleeting, sensory vision—the echo of a sound, the phantom scent of blood, the ghostly image of a footprint. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

---

You are a Bard. You are the memory in a world of amnesiacs, the truth in a city of liars. You carry a heavy burden, the weight of a thousand sad songs. They will call you a cynic, a doomsayer, a drunk. They may be right. But when the Gilded Lord is choking on his own lies, when the Saint is blinded by his own halo, when the Monster is consumed by its own rage, you will be the one left standing. And you will be the one who tells their true story.

You will stand on the grave of this whole, damned, beautiful world, clear your throat, and you will sing. Because somebody has to.
