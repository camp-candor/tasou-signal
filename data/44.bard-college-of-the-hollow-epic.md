Of course. Let's pour another finger of that amber poison, let the cicadas drone, and talk about the Bards who know the saddest truth of all: every hero's story is a tragedy, if you just sing it long enough.

## Bard College: The College of the Hollow Epic

*“I once knew a man who could charm the scales off a Wyrm-Blooded with a single smile. Fought like a cornered devil, too. Had an Heirloom that sang of his family’s glory, a Chorus of heroes a hundred deep. They wrote songs about him from here to the Ashen Plains. Glorious, triumphant things. But they never sing the last verse. They never sing about the quiet that came after. The quiet in his eyes. The quiet in his house after his wife left, because he couldn't remember her name. I sing the last verse. It ain't as pretty. But it's the only part of the story that's true.”*
- **An old Story-Spinner, to a young Gilded Scion.**

In the perfumed parlors and on the sweating verandas of the Sunken World, the story is a currency, a weapon, and a shield. The Gilded Families have built their entire society on the Great Lie, a carefully curated epic of their own nobility. The bards of the College of Glamour are their court painters, rendering these lies in beautiful, captivating song. The bards of the College of Eloquence are their lawyers, arguing the fine print of their honor.

But there is another college. A quieter, dustier, and more honest one.

The College of the Hollow Epic is not a grand institution. It has no marble halls, no gilded lecture rooms. Its campus is the back rooms of a thousand roadside taverns, the flickering firelight of a hundred lonely camps, the dusty archives of the Gilded Mausoleum where the real, unedited histories are left to rot. Its members are the Story-Spinners, the muckrakers, the grim biographers of the damned. They are the Bards who have looked upon the beautiful, triumphant tapestry of the Gilded Lie and have seen the loose threads, the bloodstains, and the patches of rot that everyone else pretends not to see.

Their philosophy is a simple and heartbreaking one: a story is not true until it is complete, and a story is not complete until you have told its tragic end. They are the keepers of the last verse. They are the scholars of the Weary Truth, and their art is the most honest, and therefore the most dangerous, magic in the world.

### The Doctrine of the Last Verse

The Bards of the Hollow Epic believe that the Fading is not just a decay of substance, but a decay of truth. The world is forgetting itself, and in its amnesia, it clings to the simplest, most comforting fictions. It remembers the hero's charge, but forgets the bloody cost. It remembers the lover's first kiss, but forgets the bitter betrayal that followed.

The sacred duty of a Hollow Epic Bard is to fight this spiritual amnesia. They are completists, archivists of the heart’s forgotten battlefields. They seek out the full story, the messy, complicated, and often ugly truth behind the polished legends. They know that true wisdom, and true power, lies not in the triumphant climax, but in the quiet, sorrowful denouement.

Their art is a form of journalism, their magic a kind of historical audit. They are the ones who will sit with the old, hollow-eyed hero and ask him not about his famous victory, but about the names of the men who died beside him. They are the ones who will read the Gilded Lord's glorious family history, and then seek out the servants' gossip to find the chapters that were left out.

### The Melancholy Art: The Bard as Historian

A Hollow Epic Bard’s relationship with their Chorus is that of a grim but dedicated biographer. They listen to the cacophony of their ancestors—the braggarts, the liars, the self-pitying poets, the proud warriors—and their great skill is to cross-reference their stories. They are the detectives of their own bloodline, piecing together the true, unvarnished story from a dozen conflicting, self-serving accounts.

This makes their magic a thing of profound, and often sorrowful, insight. They do not just channel an ancestor's power; they channel the *context* of that power.

*   **Bardic Inspiration:** When a Hollow Epic Bard inspires an ally, they are not just giving a pep talk. They are whispering a relevant, and often cautionary, historical precedent. To a Fighter facing down an impossible foe, they might say, "My great-uncle faced a beast like this at Blackwater Creek. He died, but he showed them how to kill it. Don't you make the same mistake he did." It is a gift of knowledge, wrapped in the cold cloth of a tragic memory.

*   **Spellcasting:** Their spells are not just stories; they are footnotes, corrections, and devastating revelations.
    *   *Charm Person* is not just a magical flattery; it is the Bard subtly revealing a piece of the target’s own history that they find flattering, a forgotten act of kindness or a minor, uncelebrated triumph.
    *   *Dissonant Whispers* is the opposite: a murmured account of the target’s most secret and shameful failure, a ghost story only they can hear.
    *   *Legend Lore* is their sacred rite, a deep communion not just with their own Chorus, but with the great, collective Loam-Whisper of the world, a moment where they can hear the full, tragic story of a person, place, or thing.

### Creating a Hollow Epic Bard

You have chosen a lonely and a thankless path. You are a truth-teller in a world that pays handsomely for lies. You are the one who stays until the end of the party, not to drink the last of the wine, but to hear the sad, drunken confessions after all the other guests have gone home.

Ask yourself these questions, and answer them with the weary honesty of a man who’s seen too much:

*   **What truth are you hunting?** What is the great, defining story that you are compelled to complete? Are you trying to uncover the true, ugly history of your own Gilded Family? Are you seeking the lost, final verse of a song that is said to be a cure for the Fading? Or are you simply a collector, an addict, a connoisseur of sad endings?
*   **Why can't you let the lie stand?** What happened in your past that made you this way? Did you watch a hero you admired become a hollow man? Did you discover a terrible secret about your own sainted ancestor? Why are you incapable of the Gracious Blindness that allows the rest of the world to function?
*   **What is your relationship with the truth?** Is it a weapon you wield with righteous fury? A burden you carry with weary resignation? Or is it a sickness, a morbid curiosity that you cannot control, that forces you to pick at every scab, to open every old wound, just to see what lies beneath?

### College of the Hollow Epic: Class Features

You have dedicated yourself to the art of the complete story, the sorrowful truth that lies at the end of every glorious lie. Your magic is the power of context, of memory, and of the devastating, final verse.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of the Hollow Epic at 3rd level, your endless search for the full story has made you a scholar of many fields. You gain proficiency in three skills of your choice.

#### Cutting Words
Also at 3rd level, you learn that the truest story is often the sharpest knife. You can use your knowledge of a creature's past, its lineage, its secret failures and forgotten shames, to cut through its confidence and competence.

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the Dungeon Master determines the outcome.

The creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed, or if it has no memory or history (such as most constructs and oozes).

*   **The Weave:** This is not a simple shout or a distracting noise. It is a whispered, personal, and devastating truth, a fragment of a story that only the target understands. As the Gilded Duellist lunges with a perfect, ancestral technique, you might murmur, just loud enough for them to hear, "Your father used that same lunge. It's how he lost his eye." As the Myth-Weaver chants their fiery incantation, you might call out, "Is that the same fire your great-aunt used? The one that burned the west wing and all those poor servants with it?" You are not just distracting them; you are reminding them that their power, their very history, is a story of failure as much as it is of triumph.

#### Additional Magical Secrets
At 6th level, your research into the histories of every Kin and every tradition has given you a broad and unparalleled understanding of the nature of magic. You have collected not just stories of people, but stories of power itself.

You learn two spells of your choice from any class’s spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.

#### The Weight of the Story
Starting at 14th level, your understanding of the narrative nature of reality has become a profound and unshakeable truth. You know that every life is a story, and every story has a structure, a rhythm, a weight. You have learned to put the full weight of a story behind your own actions.

When you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the Dungeon Master tells you whether you succeed or fail.

*   **The Weave:** This is not just luck. It is narrative causality. When you use this feature, you are not just trying harder; you are framing your action as the inevitable climax of a story. As you attempt to persuade the Gilded Lord, you are not just being charming; you are delivering the final, heartbreaking monologue of a tragic play. As you leap across a chasm, you are not just jumping; you are the hero in a story, and the story demands that you reach the other side. You are, for a single, perfect moment, bending the world to the logic of a good, true, and complete story.

---

You are a Bard of the Hollow Epic. You are the one who walks in the shadow of every great man, not to praise him, but to take notes for his obituary. You are a collector of sad songs, a connoisseur of beautiful ruins. The world will not thank you for your honesty. It will call you a cynic, a ghoul, a buzzard who feeds on the carcasses of legends.

Let them.

They are the ones who are afraid of the silence. You are the one who knows that the silence is where the truest music is found. You are the one who knows that every story, no matter how glorious, ends the same way: with a quiet room, a settling of dust, and the slow, patient work of the grave. And you are the only one with the courage to sing that final, honest, and heartbreaking note.
