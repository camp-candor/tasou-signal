Of course. The homepage materializes from the humid, digital ether not as a website, but as a found object: a decaying parish ledger, its leather cover cracked like dried mud. The background is a high-resolution scan of foxed, yellow-brown paper, water-stained at the edges and haunted by the faint, spectral watermark of a weeping willow. A low, unsteady flicker, as from a dying gaslamp, makes the shadows of the page seem to writhe.

### The Header: A Benediction for the Damned

At the top, etched in a typeface of bleeding, spidery ink, is the title: **"The Blackwood Parish Almanac."** Beneath it, a living date adds to the oppressive sense of place: *"The 217th Day since the River Beckoned."*

The navigation is not a bar, but a series of scorched-in labels, like brands on old wood:
*   **The Survey:** A link to the main map, an act of desperate cartography.
*   **The Testaments:** The archives, implying firsthand accounts of strange and terrible things.
*   **The Census:** A grimly formal roster of all souls, present and past.
*   **Whispers & Warnings:** The rumor board, a collection of local folklore and bad omens.

In the top-right corner, a small, wrought-iron icon of a keyhole invites the user. It does not say "Sign In." It says, **"Inscribe Your Name."**

### The Centerpiece: The Unfolding Survey

The majority of the screen is dominated by what appears to be a developing daguerreotype of a vast, untamed swampland. This is **The Survey**. Its "fog of war" is not a digital overlay, but a milky, chemical void at the edges of the image, where the landscape has yet to resolve.

The only clear point is a small huddle of salt-bleached clapboard buildings clinging to a rickety dock over murky water: the town of **Salvation**, the campaign’s fragile home base. Its icon is a lantern, casting a weak, pulsing golden light.

As the player’s cursor moves over the undeveloped haze, the milky surface swirls, revealing maddening, half-formed glimpses of what might lie within—a skeletal cypress knee, the jagged roofline of a sunken house—before they vanish back into the chemical fog.

Where past expeditions have carved paths, the photograph is disturbingly sharp. Ink-blot bayous snake through forests of cypress draped in what look less like Spanish moss and more like funeral shrouds. Clicking on a discovered landmark—a crumbling plantation manor, a circle of stones half-sunk in the mire, a gnarled hanging tree—causes the image to ripple. A tattered card, as from a forgotten tarot deck, flips over, displaying:
*   **Name:** Blackwood Manor
*   **State:** <span style="color:darkred;">Forsaken</span>
*   **Last Attended:** Day 198, by the Ferryman Company
*   **Link:** *[Bear Witness]*

The map is alive with a quiet horror. A filigree of wrought iron marks a forgotten family plot where something was recently unearthed. The slow, hypnotic pulse of a will-o'-the-wisp bobs over a particularly dark stretch of swamp. A single, ominous crow icon circles an area, unmoving, for days.

### The Testaments: A Litany of Misfortune

Below the map, the page flows into **"The Testaments,"** a collection of journal entries. Each is a yellowed page torn from a different ledger, some with spidery, elegant handwriting, others with a frantic, barely legible scrawl. The occasional Rorschach blot of a whiskey stain or a dried smear of mud adorns the margins.

A typical entry includes:
*   **The Title:** A player-written, solemn heading like "The Testament of Silas Blackwood's Folly."
*   **The Reckoning:** "Day 212 — One Soul Claimed by the Mire."
*   **The Company:** A row of faded, sun-bleached daguerreotype portraits of the participants.
*   **The Account:** A short, harrowing summary. *"Followed the old levee road to the Blackwood property. Elara was taken by something in the sugarcane field. Found a locked door in the cellar bearing the family crest, but the key we brought from the sunken chapel did not fit. We left Elara's locket on the mantelpiece as a marker and fled at dusk as the cicadas began their chorus."*
*   **The Link:** Not a button, but a smudged thumbprint of dark ink that reads "Bear Witness."

### The Census: A Roster of the Lost

Further down is **"The Census of Blackwood Parish,"** a formal ledger. The character portraits are stark, unsmiling, and posed like Victorian post-mortem photographs. Below each name, class, and level is their status, rendered in a chillingly bureaucratic hand: `Active`, `Retired`, or `Given to the Swamp`. Hovering over a portrait reveals not a quote, but a last known utterance or a line from their eulogy.

### The Final Section: Whispers & Warnings

The page ends on a splintered cypress plank nailed to the parchment. On it, scraps of paper are affixed with rusty coffin nails. This is the **Rumor Board**.
*   *"They say the bells of a sunken church still ring on moonless nights..."*
*   *"Old Man Hemlock swears he saw his own face on the thing that walks the cane fields after dark."*
*   *"Found this sketch in a bottle that washed up from the delta. Looks like a map, or a warning."*

Beneath this, the final invitation is not a call to adventure, but a somber challenge, aimed at the uninitiated visitor, floating like a ghost over the faded paper:

**"The Almanac has empty pages. The Census has names yet to be entered. Will you offer your testimony?"**

Clicking it does not open a pop-up. It simply fades the world to black before the stark, formal Clerk sign-in page appears, as if you are finally signing your name in the parish's ledger.

Understood. I am ready to receive the materials for the homepage design.

Based on the established West Marches style, the persistent world, and the "Living Chronicle" concept, the homepage must serve a dual purpose: it is both a **gateway for new players** and a **dynamic town square for the existing community**. It should not be a static product brochure but a living window into the game world itself.

My design will be structured around this philosophy. I will integrate the materials you provide to define the visual identity and narrative voice of the following key components.

### The Homepage Design Blueprint

#### 1. **The Hero Section: "The Town Square at the Edge of the Wilderness"**
*   **Purpose:** To immediately establish the theme and provide the primary calls-to-action.
*   **Visuals:** Will use your provided hero art or logo as a central or background element. The aesthetic should evoke exploration and mystery (e.g., an animated, slowly-unfurling map; a flickering campfire; a vista of a dangerous, unknown landscape).
*   **Narrative:** Will use your provided tagline and introductory text.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Primary CTA for New Players:** A prominent "Join the Expedition" button, which will scroll down to the "Join the Roster" section.
    *   **Primary CTA for Returning Players:** A "View the Chronicle" button, which links to the main Astro site's map/log pages.
    *   **Clerk Integration:** A `<SignInButton>` or `<UserButton>` in the top-right corner, making authentication a persistent element.

#### 2. **The "Living Chronicle" Dashboard: A Window into the World**
*   **Purpose:** To "show, don't tell." This section proves the world is persistent and player-driven by displaying live data pulled from the GitHub repository at build time.
*   **Visuals:** Will use icons, borders, or textures from your materials to frame these data widgets.
*   **Functionality (Three-column layout):**
    *   **"Recent Expeditions":** A feed displaying the titles and dates of the last 3-5 session logs (`/sessions/`). Each entry links to the full report. This shows the community is active.
    *   **"World Map Fragment":** A non-interactive image of the main world map, perhaps with discovered areas filled in and unexplored areas shrouded in fog. This visualizes the scope of the West Marches.
    *   **"Rumor Board Ticker":** A scrolling or cycling list of the latest 3-5 "unverified" rumors from the `/rumors/` directory. This creates immediate intrigue.

#### 3. **The Value Proposition: "How It Works"**
*   **Purpose:** To concisely explain the unique nature of this TTRPG experience to new visitors.
*   **Narrative:** Will use your provided text to explain the core concepts.
*   **Functionality (Two-column layout):**
    *   **"Cinematic, AI-Powered Play":** Describes the in-game experience with the Scrying Mirror and AI Dungeon Master.
    *   **"A Persistent, Community-Forged World":** Explains the West Marches principles: player agency, the Living Chronicle, and the fact that their actions will permanently change the world.

#### 4. **"Join the Roster" Section: The Onboarding Funnel**
*   **Purpose:** To provide a clear, step-by-step path for a new player to join the campaign.
*   **Narrative:** Will use your text to guide the user.
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **"Sign Up":** A large `<SignUpButton>` powered by Clerk. This is the main action.
    2.  **"Create Your Character":** Brief instructions guiding the user to the character creation tool (once they are signed in).
    3.  **"Join the Community":** A link to the community hub (e.g., Discord server), which is essential for the West Marches social layer.

I am prepared to integrate your materials—be they visual assets, narrative copy, or specific lore—into this structure to create a homepage that is both functional and thematically resonant with your vision.
