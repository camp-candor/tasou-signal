Of course. Let us now catalogue the forms of beautiful decay. In a world where every soul is a haunted house, a class is simply the shape of its ghosts. This is not a list of professions, but a bestiary of the human heart, a grim and poetic diagnosis of the ways a soul can bleed.

## Chapter 3: The Shape of the Haunting - Player Classes in a Cursed World

Sit down, child. The air is thick with stories tonight. You’ve come to me with that look in your eye, the one that says you’re ready to have your future written on your skin. You want to know what you will *be*. A warrior? A scholar? A priest?

Throw those words away. They are the cheap, flimsy currency of other, healthier worlds. Here, in the Sunken World, we do not have professions; we have afflictions. We do not have callings; we have compulsions, whispered from the grave. Your class is not a choice you make. It is a symptom of the particular fever in your blood, a diagnosis of the way your family’s ghosts have chosen to haunt you.

You wish to know what you will be? Then look to your Heirloom, listen to the Chorus, and find the shape of your haunting. This is not a catalogue of heroes. It is a litany of the beautifully, tragically damned. It is the story of you.

### The Barbarian: A Fever in the Blood

*“They call it my rage. A quaint parlor-room word for it. It is not my rage. It is a fever, a fire stoked by a hundred screaming ancestors who remember what it was to be gods. I do not fight to win. I fight to achieve that one, blissful, silent moment after the screaming stops.”*

**The Tragedy:** The Barbarian is not a savage; they are a pressure cooker. They are the most direct and unvarnished conduit for the Chorus in its rawest, most primal form. While other Kin learn to placate, to bargain with, or to silence the dead, the Barbarian’s soul is a faulty dam, holding back an ocean of ancestral fury. Their famous rage is not an emotion they choose to feel. It is a catastrophic failure of that dam, a moment of possession where the screaming will of their warrior ancestors floods their consciousness, granting them terrifying strength at the cost of their own self. They are a walking, breathing monument to the idea that some ghosts are too loud to be ignored.

**The Heirloom's Expression:** The Barbarian’s power is a desperate, violent form of therapy. Their **Rage** is the one act that can drown out the Chorus. By unleashing their own, personal fury in a glorious, terrible scream, they can momentarily deafen themselves to the ghosts. For a few precious seconds, the only voice in their head is their own. It is a blissful, addictive silence, and they will chase it into the jaws of any monster. Their abilities are manifestations of this inner war: **Relentless Endurance** is an ancestor’s ghost refusing to let its vessel die; **Brutal Critical** is a hero-ghost’s famous finishing move briefly taking over.

**Role in the Decaying World:** Barbarians are most common among the Ash-Branded, for whom this inner war is a cultural norm. However, any lineage with a sufficiently violent history can produce one. A Gilded Scion with a line of famous duellists might become a polished, terrifyingly focused Barbarian, their rage a cold, precise fury. They are the outcasts, the bodyguards, the pit-fighters—anyone whose position in society allows for, and even encourages, these necessary, violent releases.

**Suggested Subclasses (Primal Paths):**
*   **Path of the Berserker:** The purest, most tragic form. You have completely surrendered to the Scream. Your Frenzy is a full-blown possession, a ride-along in your own body as a blood-crazed ancestor takes the wheel.
*   **Path of the Zealot:** You are a vessel for a Saint’s fury. Your rage is a holy crusade, your power a divine judgment. You are a Paladin who has lost the argument with their own god.
*   **Path of the Beast:** The Chimera Cult’s masterpiece. Your Chorus is a menagerie of monstrous ancestors, and your rage is a grotesque, physical transformation as their traits—claws, fangs, tails—literally tear their way out of your skin.
*   **Path of the Ancestral Guardian:** You do not just channel your ancestors; you project them. Your rage summons the actual, spectral forms of your guardians, their ghostly hands guiding your blade and shielding your allies.

### The Bard: The Gilded Cage's Songbird

*“Oh, we all know the story of the Midnight Duellist, my dear. A tale of honor and tragedy. But I also know the *other* story. The one about the card game that started the whole affair. The one about his wife’s secret. All stories are true, you see. Especially the ones we don’t tell. My art is knowing which story to sing, and which to keep as a knife in my sleeve.”*

**The Tragedy:** The Bard is the ultimate performer of the Gilded Lie. They are the keepers of the family stories, the curators of a history that is constantly being edited for public consumption. While the Myth-Weaver is the scholar, the Bard is the propagandist. Their magic is the power of narrative itself, the ability to shape perception, to evoke emotion, and to convince the world that the family’s crumbling, vine-choked manor is still a palace. Their tragedy is that they know, better than anyone, that it’s all a lie. They are the beautiful, charming songbird that sings the loudest to distract from the rot in the cage.

**The Heirloom's Expression:** The Bard’s magic is a direct manipulation of the Chorus, but not for power—for performance. Their **Bardic Inspiration** is the act of lending a fragment of an ancestor’s story to an ally, a fleeting, ghostly confidence. Their **Song of Rest** is a sad, ancestral lullaby that soothes the soul by reminding it of a simpler, less complicated past. Their spells are stories made manifest: *Charm Person* is a whispered compliment from a legendary courtier; *Vicious Mockery* is a devastatingly witty insult from a famously sharp-tongued great-aunt.

**Role in the Decaying World:** Bards are the heart of Gilded society. They are the diplomats, the entertainers, the keepers of secrets. They thrive on the veranda, their languid storytelling a vital part of the social ecosystem. Silt-Folk Bards are the keepers of a different kind of story—the folk tales and survival guides of their people, their magic a communal act of remembrance.

**Suggested Subclasses (Bard Colleges):**
*   **College of Eloquence:** The Politician. You are a master of the Gilded Lie, your magic the art of the half-truth and the silken, binding promise.
*   **College of Glamour:** The Belle of the Ball. You channel the echoes of your family’s most beautiful and desired ancestors, your magic a thing of captivating presence and heartbreaking charm.
*   **College of Lore:** The Secret-Keeper. You are the family historian, the one who knows where all the bodies are buried because your Chorus remembers the funerals. You trade in the Weary Truth as much as the Gilded Lie.
*   **College of Whispers:** The Spy. You are the shadow on the veranda, the one who weaponizes secrets. You channel your lineage’s assassins and blackmailers, your magic a thing of paranoia and psychic poison.

### The Cleric and the Paladin: The Weight of the Halo

These two classes are explored in detail in Chapter 8: The Saint’s Glare. They are the Vessels, the priests and crusaders of the ancestral Saints. Their tragedy is the tyranny of purity, the crushing weight of a perfect, uncompromising virtue in a flawed and dying world. The Cleric listens to the Saint’s sermon; the Paladin becomes its bloody, mailed fist.

---

### The Druid and the Ranger: The Sermon of the Kudzu

These classes are explored in detail in Chapter 10: The Sermon of the Kudzu. They are the heretics who have turned from the ghosts of their blood to listen to the older, wilder Chorus of the land itself. Their tragedy is the slow, patient loss of their humanity as they are absorbed into the beautiful, monstrous, and uncaring cycle of the Green Rot. The Druid is the priest of this cycle; the Ranger is its grim and practical predator.

### The Fighter: A Body's Bitter Memory

*“The Myth-Weaver speaks of channeling his ancestors. The Poet sings of their glory. I do neither. My body simply… remembers. It remembers the lunge, the parry, the feel of the blade breaking bone. It is a memory I do not want, a skill I did not ask for. But it is the only thing that has kept me alive.”*

**The Tragedy:** The Fighter is the ultimate pragmatist. They have no time for the high-minded philosophies of the other classes. Their relationship with their Heirloom is not spiritual or intellectual; it is purely physical. They are a body haunted by a legacy of violence. Their magic is not in their mind, but in their muscle memory. They are the descendants of soldiers, duelists, and guards, and their Chorus does not whisper words—it screams in the language of trained reflexes and perfected violence. Their tragedy is this profound, weary detachment from their own power. They are a living weapon, and they often feel as much a stranger to their own body as a swordsman is to his sword.

**The Heirloom's Expression:** The Fighter’s abilities are the non-magical, kinesthetic echoes of their lineage. **Action Surge** is a sudden, shocking burst of pure, ancestral muscle memory, a moment where their body moves with a speed and precision that is not their own. **Second Wind** is the remembered resilience of a dozen ancestors who refused to die. Their skill with a blade is not just their own training; it is the perfected art of a hundred duelists who came before.

**Role in the Decaying World:** Fighters are everywhere. They are the Gilded Family’s honor-bound duelist, the grim Geode Hearth-Sworn, the practical Silt-Folk bodyguard, the Ash-Branded warrior fighting for control. They are the professionals in a world of haunted amateurs.

**Suggested Subclasses (Martial Archetypes):**
*   **Battle Master:** The Tactician. Your maneuvers are the remembered lessons of a great general or a legendary duelist ancestor.
*   **Samurai:** The Stoic. Your focus is not rage, but a cold, perfect stillness, a technique learned from an ancestor who achieved a state of absolute control.
*   **Rune Knight:** A Geode tradition. You do not just channel your ancestors; you literally carve their stories—their Grudge-Stones—onto your weapons and armor, drawing power from their unyielding will.
*   **Echo Knight:** The most literal expression of the Fighter’s haunting. You do not just remember your ancestor; you summon a faded, ghostly echo of them to fight alongside you.

### The Monk: The Heresy of Silence

*“They are all so loud. My family. My history. A constant, screaming demand for attention. They offer power, yes. But I have found a greater power. It is the power of a quiet room. It is the power of my own, untroubled, silent breath.”*

**The Tragedy:** The Monk is the ultimate heretic. In a world where all power is derived from the Chorus, the Monk has declared war on the very concept. They are the practitioners of the Kindred of the Blank Canvas, the seekers of the Un-Weaving. Their every action is an attempt to silence the ghosts, to push back the tide of the past, and to achieve a state of perfect, untainted selfhood. Their tragedy is the sheer, impossible scale of their ambition. They seek to find a quiet room in the heart of a hurricane, to be a single, silent soul in a world made entirely of noise.

**The Heirloom's Expression:** The Monk’s abilities are a form of anti-magic, a spiritual martial art designed to master the self. Their **Ki** is not an external power, but the focused energy of their own, personal will, a weapon against the intrusion of the Chorus. **Stunning Strike** is a precise, psychic blow that disrupts an opponent’s connection to their own Chorus, momentarily stunning the ghosts within them. Their serene poise is a suit of armor against their own history.

**Role in the Decaying World:** Monks are rare, secretive, and hunted. They are the hidden ascetics of the Brotherhood of Unburdened Skin, living in remote Still-Granges. To the Gilded establishment, they are the most dangerous of terrorists, for they do not just threaten the social order; they threaten the very source of its power.

**Suggested Subclasses (Monastic Traditions):**
*   **Way of the Open Hand:** The Pragmatist. You have mastered the art of shutting down another’s power, of controlling the flow of the Chorus in yourself and others.
*   **Way of Shadow:** The Secret. You have learned to silence your presence as well as your soul, becoming a ghost of a different kind—one that has no past.
*   **Way of Mercy:** The Physician of the Soul. You have turned your art inward, learning not just to silence your ghosts, but to soothe them, bringing a quiet peace to the wounded Heirlooms of others. You are a heretical healer in a world of haunted patients.

### The Rogue: A Secret Passed Down

*“My great-grandmother could steal the pearls from a Gilded Lady’s necklace in the middle of a crowded ballroom. My grandfather could steal a secret from a man’s mind with a few kind words and a glass of cheap whiskey. I can do both. It’s the family business.”*

**The Tragedy:** The Rogue is the inheritor of a legacy of whispers. Their ancestors were not great heroes or monsters; they were the people in the shadows, the spies, the assassins, the con artists, the secret-keepers. Their Chorus is not a loud demand, but a quiet, paranoid, and intensely practical murmur. They are haunted by a legacy of cunning, and their tragedy is a profound, deep-seated inability to trust anyone—most especially the ghosts whispering in their own ear, who are all, to a one, accomplished liars.

**The Heirloom's Expression:** The Rogue’s magic is the cunning of the dead. **Sneak Attack** is not just a well-placed blow; it is a whispered trick from a dead cutthroat, a phantom hand guiding the blade to the perfect weak spot. **Cunning Action** is the remembered agility of a cat burglar, an instinct for survival honed over a hundred rooftops. Their skills are not just learned; they are inherited instincts.

**Role in the Decaying World:** Rogues are the gears in the great, rotting clockwork of the society. They are the Silt-Folk Mamas and Papas, the Gilded family’s "fixers," the information brokers, and the quiet blades that enforce the unspoken laws.

**Suggested Subclasses (Roguish Archetypes):**
*   **Thief:** The Heirloom of the Cat Burglar. Your reflexes and agility are a direct inheritance from a line of second-story artists.
*   **Assassin:** The Family Poisoner. You have inherited the cold, precise knowledge of a hundred different ways to kill a man without leaving a trace.
*   **Mastermind:** The Secret-Keeper. Your power comes from a line of spymasters and manipulators. You don’t just hear your own Chorus; you have a knack for listening to the secrets of others.
*   **Phantom:** The Medium. You have a more direct and ghastly connection to the dead than most. You do not just channel your own ancestors; you can speak with the fresh, chattering ghosts of your victims.

### The Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard: The Heretics and the Scholars

These classes represent the exceptions and the students of the world’s magical rules. Their nature is explored in the previous chapters on the Camps and Lodges of Magic.

*   **The Sorcerer (The Faded-Touched):** Is the anomaly, a living conduit for the world’s decay or its dying hope. Their tragedy is their utter lack of control, their power a beautiful, terrifying cancer of the soul.
*   **The Warlock (The Pact-Bound):** Is the ultimate pragmatist, a heretic who has traded the chaotic tyranny of their own family’s ghosts for the focused, contractual tyranny of a stranger. Their tragedy is that a cage is still a cage, even if you choose your own warden.
*   **The Wizard (The Myth-Weaver):** Is the scholar of the soul, the genealogist of ghosts. Their tragedy is that they, more than anyone, understand the terrible, irreversible cost of the Art they practice. They are the morticians, and they see the rot in every beautiful face.

Choose your class. Choose the shape of your personal, beautiful, and inescapable ruin. Welcome to the Sunken World. The ghosts are waiting.
