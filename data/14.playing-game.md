## The Vine-Choked Path: Playing a Southern Gothic Fantasy Campaign

So, you’ve felt the pull of the Sunken World. You’ve heard the whisper of the Chorus in your blood and felt the phantom weight of an Heirloom on your skin. You are ready to walk the vine-choked path. But be warned: this is not a journey for the faint of heart, nor for those who expect the straightforward heroism of other realms. This is not a world of shining knights and benevolent gods. This is a place of sweltering heat, simmering resentment, and beautiful, terrible decay.

This chapter is a guide for players and Chroniclers alike, a flickering lantern to illuminate the unique challenges and profound rewards of a Southern Gothic fantasy campaign. Here, the goal is not merely to survive, but to endure. The conflicts are not just of sword and sorcery, but of soul and memory. And the greatest treasure is not a chest of gold, but a single, untarnished truth in a world drowning in noble lies.

### The Pillars of the Sunken World: Atmosphere is Everything

Before you choose a class or roll a single die, you must understand the foundations of the setting. In Mythos Tattoo, the atmosphere is not just window dressing; it is an active antagonist, a constant pressure that shapes every story and every character. To play a successful campaign, the Chronicler must evoke, and the players must embrace, these four pillars.

#### Pillar One: The Oppressive Atmosphere

The Sunken World is suffocating. The air is thick and wet, smelling of sweet jasmine and the slow, pungent rot of the bayou. The sun is a merciless, brassy eye in a bleached-white sky, beating down on the crumbling facades of Gilded Manors and the corrugated tin roofs of shantytowns alike. The nights offer no relief, only a different kind of heat, a close, watchful darkness alive with the drone of cicadas and the croaking of unseen things in the marsh.

**For the Chronicler:** Your descriptions are your most powerful tool. Don’t just say it’s hot; describe the way a character’s linen shirt sticks to their back, the trickle of sweat that traces a line through the dust on their cheek, the way the air is too heavy to draw a full breath. Describe the silence of a Faded Land, where even the birds have forgotten their songs. Describe the slow, deliberate movement of people, their energy sapped by the heat and the hopelessness. The environment should feel less like a place and more like a fever dream from which the characters can never quite wake. Use the landscape to mirror the emotional state of the story: a tense negotiation takes place in a stifling, airless drawing-room; a moment of violent passion erupts during a sudden, torrential thunderstorm.

**For the Player:** Your character is a product of this environment. How do they cope? Are they languid and resigned, moving with the slow, deliberate pace of the world? Or do they rage against it, their energy a stark and often foolish contrast to the oppressive calm? Does the heat shorten your temper? Does the constant decay feed a nihilistic streak, or does it inspire a desperate urge to protect what little beauty remains? Let the atmosphere seep into your roleplaying. Your character is never comfortable; they are always enduring.

#### Pillar Two: The Grotesque and the Uncanny

Southern Gothic is fascinated by the grotesque, the unsettling mingling of the beautiful and the monstrous. This is not about simple orcs and goblins. The grotesque in the Sunken World is deeply personal and often tragically human.

The most obvious example is the **Ink-Bled**. These are the cautionary tales, the wretches whose Heirlooms have consumed them entirely. They are not mindless zombies; they are walking, screaming perversions of their own legacy. A man whose ancestors were great hunters might become a feral beast, his skin a shifting tapestry of fur and claw tattoos, his mind lost to a primal, predatory hunger. A matriarch whose lineage was famed for its beauty might become a horrifying creature of vanity, her Heirloom of celestial flowers having turned parasitic, her face a serene, unmoving mask of bark-like skin while thorny vines writhe beneath. These creatures are grotesque because they are a mirror of what the player characters could become. Fighting one is not just combat; it is a confrontation with a possible future.

The uncanny, however, is subtler and often more terrifying. It is the Gilded Lord, his body a perfect work of art, who smiles with his mouth but not his eyes because his tattoo of Sovereignty has devoured the memory of his own children. It is the perfect, beautiful hostess of a decaying manor who serves a feast of exquisitely prepared food that has no taste, an Anchored memory of a banquet from a less Faded time. The horror comes from the normal being twisted just enough to be wrong.

**For the Chronicler:** Populate your world with flawed, memorable, and often unsettling characters. The villain isn't just evil; they are driven by a warped sense of family honor, their actions dictated by the whispers of a malevolent ancestor in their Chorus. The helpful NPC isn’t just friendly; they are unnervingly cheerful, their joy a desperate performance to keep the sadness of their own Grief-Marks at bay.

**For the Player:** Your character is also flawed. In a world defined by grotesque legacies, you are not a shining hero. What is your flaw? What secret shame do you carry? What sin did your great-grandmother commit that you are now forced to answer for? Embrace the grotesque within your own character. Perhaps your pact with your ancestors manifests in a physical way—a slight tremor in your hand, a scent of grave dirt that clings to you, a second set of whispers that only you can hear.

#### Pillar Three: The Tyranny of the Past

"The past is never dead. It's not even past." This is the central creed of the Sunken World. The Heirloom system makes this concept terrifyingly literal. A character’s bloodline is not a passive backstory; it is an active, often intrusive, cast of supporting characters living inside their skin.

**For the Chronicler:** The Chorus is your direct line into a player character’s soul. Treat their ancestors as individual NPCs. A character’s great-grandfather, a notorious riverboat gambler, might offer advice during a card game, demanding a bit of the winnings in return. The spirit of a pious matriarch might flare with cold disapproval when the character tells a lie, imposing disadvantage on the Deception roll. You can create entire adventures centered around the unfinished business of the Chorus. A quest might be required to find a lost locket to appease a sorrowful spirit, thereby unlocking a new ability from the Heirloom. A powerful enemy might know the secret shame of a character’s ancestor and use that knowledge as blackmail, threatening to reveal a truth that would disgrace their entire lineage.

**For the Player:** Your relationship with your Chorus is the core of your character’s internal conflict. Do you embrace it, willingly ceding control for power? Do you resent it, fighting to keep your own thoughts clear from the constant whispering? Do you have a favorite ancestor you converse with? Is there one you fear, whose influence you actively resist? This internal struggle should be a constant source of roleplaying. When you use an Heirloom ability, describe it not just as a magical effect, but as an ancestor’s memory or skill briefly surfacing. You didn’t just instinctively parry that blow; you felt your grandfather’s scarred knuckles guiding your own, and for a fleeting moment, you smelled the cigar smoke he favored.

#### Pillar Four: A Decaying Social Order

The Sunken World is a society built on a rigid and hypocritical class system, a cracked mirror of the Old South. At the top are the **Gilded Families**, the landed aristocracy who live in decaying manors, clinging to the faded glory of their lineage. They see themselves as the noble preservers of reality, yet their practice of Anchoring is what accelerates the Fading. They are obsessed with blood purity, honor, and tradition, even as their traditions strangle the world.

Below them are the **Common Folk**, the tenant farmers, artisans, and laborers who live in the Faded Lands. They are the ones who bear the true cost of the Gilded’s "preservation," living in a world of grey and dust.

At the very bottom are the **Blank-Skins**, the Unmarked. They are the ultimate outcasts, seen as soulless and without purpose. They are the great fear and the great secret of the society—the living proof that the system of Heirlooms is not the only way to exist.

**For the Chronicler:** Social encounters in this world should be as tense and dangerous as any combat. Navigating a soirée at a Gilded Manor is a minefield of unspoken rules, veiled insults, and bitter rivalries. A misstep in etiquette could ruin a family’s reputation for a generation. Use this social structure to create conflict. The players might be hired by a Gilded lord to handle a delicate matter, only to discover he is a monstrous hypocrite. They might champion the cause of the common folk, sparking a populist uprising that threatens the fragile balance of power. Or they might uncover a conspiracy involving the Blank-Skins, forcing them to question the very nature of their ink-bound society.

**For the Player:** Your character’s lineage and tattoos define their place in this world. How do you feel about it? If you are from a Gilded Family, are you a proud defender of your heritage or chafing under the weight of its expectations? If you are common-born, are you resentful of the Gilded, or do you aspire to their power, blind to the cost? Social status is a constant factor in your interactions. A Gilded noble will not speak to a commoner as an equal, and a Blank-Skin will be met with fear and suspicion everywhere they go.

### Running the Game: A World of Personal Horror

A Mythos Tattoo campaign requires a shift in focus from traditional D&D. The scale is smaller, the stakes more personal. Here’s how to adapt the mechanics and mindset of Fifth Edition to fit the vine-choked path.

#### Redefining the Adventure

Your adventures are not about clearing out dungeons full of monsters for loot. They are slow-burn investigations, tense social dramas, and desperate journeys into the heart of a mystery.

*   **Instead of a Dungeon Crawl, a Manor Intrusion:** The party needs to uncover a secret from a rival family. The "dungeon" is the rival’s crumbling, labyrinthine manor. The "traps" are social—gossiping servants, suspicious guards, magical wards tied to the family’s own Heirlooms. The "monsters" might be a single, terrifying Ink-Bled relative locked in the attic, and the "treasure" is a hidden diary or a skin-scroll that reveals a dark secret.

*   **Instead of Slaying a Dragon, Appeasing a Ghost:** The party’s goal is to stop a powerful ancestor from haunting a player character. This requires an investigation into the ancestor’s life, a journey to find their unmarked grave in a forgotten corner of the swamp, and a final, fraught ritual to put their spirit to rest. Combat might be involved—fighting off grotesque swamp creatures drawn to the ghost’s sorrow—but the climax is a roleplaying encounter, not a boss fight.

*   **Instead of a Quest for a Magic Sword, a Hunt for Pure Ink:** The party needs a new, powerful tattoo to overcome an obstacle. This requires a perilous expedition into the Faded Lands to find a source of potent Marrow-Ink—perhaps the last patch of truly vibrant nightshade, or the petrified heart of a slain beast of legend. The journey itself, through a landscape bleached of reality, is the primary challenge.

#### Magic: A Gilded Curse

In Fifth Edition, magic is often a reliable and clean tool. In Mythos Tattoo, it should feel organic, dangerous, and costly.

When a player casts a spell using their Heirloom, ask them to describe it through the lens of their Chorus. A *Fireball* is not just a bead of flame; it is the screaming rage of a war-maddened ancestor erupting from their skin. A *Cure Wounds* spell is the gentle, soothing memory of a grandmother’s touch, flowing through their hands.

Consider introducing a narrative cost. Every time a character channels their Chorus in a powerful way, you, the Chronicler, can note it down. Later, you can call upon that debt. The character might have a flashback to one of their ancestor’s traumatic memories at a crucial moment, or wake up with a new, unsettling personality quirk. This reinforces the central theme: power comes at the price of the self. For a more mechanical approach, consider using the Sanity score from the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* or awarding levels of exhaustion to represent the strain of channeling the dead.

#### Combat: Brutal, Desperate, and Personal

Combat in the Sunken World should feel less like a heroic clash and more like a desperate, ugly brawl. The enemies are often tragic figures—Ink-Bled horrors that were once people, or Gilded rivals who are just as trapped by their legacies as the players are.

Describe combat in visceral, grotesque terms. When a character smites an Ink-Bled, don’t just say they deal radiant damage. Describe the holy energy causing the corrupted tattoos to blister and peel away from the creature’s flesh, releasing the scent of burnt ink and ozone. A critical hit might not just kill an enemy, but shatter a key part of their Heirloom tattoo, causing a backlash of psychic energy that reveals a fleeting, tragic memory of the person they used to be. Every fight should leave a mark, literally and figuratively.

### The Unwritten Chapter

Ultimately, a campaign in the Sunken World is a collaborative story about memory, family, and the search for identity in a world that wants to write your story for you. It is a game for players who want to explore complex characters and for Chroniclers who want to tell moody, atmospheric tales with a touch of the grotesque.

The heroes of these stories are not the ones with the most powerful tattoos, but the ones who manage to hold onto a piece of themselves against the overwhelming tide of the past. They are the ones who, when faced with the choice between a glorious legacy and a single, personal memory, hesitate. In that hesitation, in that moment of quiet defiance against the Chorus, lies the heart of the struggle.

Your skin is the page. The ink is the blood of your history. The story is waiting. But the ending is not yet written. Grab your needle. It’s time to leave your mark.
