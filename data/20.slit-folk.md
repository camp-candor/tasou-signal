Of course. Let us now turn our attention from the unmoving hills of the Geodes and look to the delta, to the Murky Hem where the great river finally gives up its ghost to the sea. Here, in a world of shifting tides and whispered secrets, we find the most underestimated, and therefore the most dangerous, of all the Kin: the Silt-Folk.

## Chapter 3.4: The Silt-Folk - The Secret Keepers

*“The Gilded Lord thinks I cannot hear him from the kitchens. He does not understand that this whole house is my ear, and his secrets are the sweetest spice in my gumbo. He worries about the assassin’s blade. He should worry about the cook’s memory.”*
- **Mama Agnes, Matriarch of the St. Clair Manor Staff.**

In the grand, tragic opera of the Sunken World, the River-Folk are the vain tenors, the Cypress Kin the melancholic sopranos, and the Geodes the rumbling, resolute bass. The Silt-Folk, however, are none of these. They are the stagehands dressed in black, the ones who move the scenery and know where every trapdoor is. They are the audience’s murmur, the collective, rustling consciousness that sees everything, hears everything, and is noticed by no one. And in a world built on performance and deception, the ones who are truly invisible are the ones who hold all the power.

To the Gilded Families, the Silt-Folk are a simple, unfortunate necessity, like well-trained hounds or sturdy furniture. They are the halflings of the delta, the river-rats who crew their barges, cook their meals, and clean their manors. They are seen as cheerful, simple, and utterly insignificant. This catastrophic underestimation is the Silt-Folk’s shield, their sword, and the central, delicious irony of their existence. While the other Kin wrestle with the epic, soul-crushing legacies of heroes and monsters, the Silt-Folk are buoyed by a single, practical, and unyielding truth: a secret is worth more than a sword, and survival is the only victory that counts.

### The Murky Hem: A World in Constant Motion

The homeland of the Silt-Folk is not a kingdom of stone or a city of towers, but a place of perpetual flux. The Murky Hem is a sprawling, labyrinthine delta where the great river frays into a thousand smaller channels before surrendering to the salt of the sea. It is a world of houseboats and stilt-shacks, of rope bridges and floating markets, all connected in a ramshackle, ever-changing web. The very ground beneath their feet is an unreliable narrator, appearing and disappearing with the turning of the tides.

This environment has shaped them. Unlike the Gilded, who desperately try to Anchor the world and hold back the Fading, the Silt-Folk have embraced impermanence. Their philosophy is that of the water: to be strong, you must be fluid. To survive, you must adapt. Their homes are not built to last for centuries, but to be easily repaired, moved, or rebuilt. They hoard little in the way of material wealth, for the next flood could take it all. Their wealth is in their relationships, their knowledge, and the intricate web of favors and secrets that binds their communities together. This fluid existence gives them a unique perspective on the world’s decay. The Fading is not a terrifying existential threat to them; it is simply another tide to be navigated.

### The Charm-Cloth Heirloom: A Scrapbook of the Soul

A Silt-Folk’s Heirloom is a perfect reflection of their culture: a practical, communal, and deeply underestimated work of art. They do not have the flawless, narrative masterpieces of the River-Folk or the glowing, symbiotic lichens of the Cypress Kin. A Silt-Folk’s skin is a **"Charm-Cloth,"** a living scrapbook of their community’s wisdom.

Their tattoos are a patchwork of dozens, sometimes hundreds, of small, seemingly random symbols. Each one is a "Charm," a piece of practical magic or a vital piece of information, added over a lifetime. The inks are humble and homemade: a black from river-bottom soot and catfish bile, a rusty red from ground-up iron salvage, a dull blue from a particular strain of river-delta mussel.

A Charm is rarely about a heroic ancestor. It is about a useful one. A young Silt-Folk might receive their first Charm of a "Knotted Rope," not from a legendary warrior, but from their great-uncle who was the best knot-tyer on the river, granting them an uncanny knack for securing barges and escaping bonds. They might get a Charm of a "Whispering Reed" from a grandmother who was a peerless gossip, allowing them to better overhear secrets. Another Charm might be a "Catfish’s Barb," from a fisherman who knew how to find food in the leanest of times, granting them advantage on survival checks to forage.

The Charm-Cloth is a messy, beautiful, and intensely personal document. It is not a story of glory; it is a user’s manual for survival, written by the generations who came before.

### The Chorus of the Commons: A Murmur of Practicality

The Silt-Folk’s Chorus is as unique as their Heirloom. They are not haunted by the individual, dramatic ghosts of their ancestors. Theirs is the **"Chorus of the Commons,"** a collective, psychic murmur of the community itself. It is not the resonant Hum of the Geodes or the screaming of the Ash-Branded. It is the sound of a thousand grandmothers telling you to wear a coat, a thousand uncles advising you on which floorboard creaks, a thousand cousins whispering about who is cheating at cards.

This Chorus does not offer epic power or visions of destiny. It offers relentless, practical, and often life-saving advice. A Silt-Folk walking into a tavern doesn’t just see a room full of people; their Chorus gives them a faint, instinctual nudge about who is armed, who is lying, and who has had too much to drink. A Silt-Folk tasting a Gilded Lord’s wine doesn’t just taste the vintage; their Chorus might give them a faint, phantom bitterness on the tongue, the collected memory of a great-aunt who knew the taste of that particular poison.

This makes them incredibly difficult to deceive or surprise. While the Gilded are busy navel-gazing at the grand opera of their own lineage, the Silt-Folk are listening to the quiet, collective wisdom of every common person who ever learned how to survive in the cracks of the world.

### A Gumbo Pot Society: The Way of the Water-Rat

The Silt-Folk have a saying: "Life is a gumbo pot. Everyone throws something in, and everyone gets a bowl." Their society is not a rigid pyramid, but a sprawling, chaotic, and deeply interconnected web of mutual obligation.

**The Mamas and the Papas:** Leadership is informal and earned through respect, not inherited by blood. The elders who have proven their wisdom and cunning are known as "Mamas" and "Papas." They are the keepers of the community’s secrets, the arbiters of disputes, and the strategists who guide their people through the dangerous world of the Gilded. To have the favor of a Mama is to have the support of the entire community. To earn her ire is to find yourself suddenly, mysteriously, alone.

**The Web of Favors:** The currency of the Silt-Folk is not coin, but favors. A fisherman who shares his catch with a boat-builder is not just being generous; he is making a deposit. Later, when his hull springs a leak, he will make a withdrawal. This web is vast and complex, extending from the Murky Hem into the very heart of the Gilded Manors. The Silt-Folk who work as servants are the eyes and ears of the entire community, their gathered intelligence flowing back through the web, ensuring that the Mamas know what the Gilded Lords are planning before the lords themselves have made a final decision.

**The Silent Supper:** Silt-Folk traditions are quiet and communal. When a member of the community dies, their family holds a "Silent Supper." A place is set for the deceased, and their favorite meal is served. No words are spoken. Instead, stories are told through gestures, through the sharing of food, through the quiet pat of a hand on a shoulder. It is a ritual that honors the dead, reinforces community bonds, and, most practically, ensures that no grieving, incautious words are overheard by outsiders.

### Playing a Silt-Folk Character

When you create a Silt-Folk character, you are creating a survivor and a secret-keeper. You are a master of appearing to be less than you are. Your strength is not in direct confrontation, but in cunning, observation, and the quiet power of your community.

*   **The Listener:** You work as a servant in a Gilded Manor, a bartender in a high-class establishment, or a deckhand on a noble’s barge. You are a ghost in the machine, your face forgettable, your presence unremarkable. But you are the repository for a thousand dangerous secrets. Your adventure begins when you overhear something you were not meant to, something that threatens not just the powerful, but your own community back in the Murky Hem.

*   **The Smuggler (The Tide-Runner):** You are a master of the delta’s hidden channels and the city’s secret pathways. You move goods, people, and information for a price. You are beholden to no one but your own code, but you are still a part of the Silt-Folk web. Your story might be a classic tale of a job gone wrong, forcing you to use your wits to outmaneuver a powerful Gilded Family who wants you silenced.

*   **The Story-Spinner:** You are the memory of your people made manifest. You might be a musician, a puppeteer, or simply a charismatic raconteur. You do not just tell tales; you weave the web of the community. Your Charms are a library of folk tales and cautionary warnings, and your Chorus is a font of endless stories. You might be on a quest to find a "lost story," a piece of your people's history that was stolen or suppressed by the Gilded.

*   **The Mama's Eyes:** You are a young Silt-Folk who has been chosen by a powerful Mama to be her agent in the wider world. You are her eyes and ears, sent to investigate a threat, make a deal, or discreetly solve a problem that the community cannot handle internally. You have the weight of your Mama’s expectations on your shoulders, and failure is not an option.

### Silt-Folk Traits

Your Silt-Folk character has the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**Age.** Silt-Folk mature quickly and live about as long as River-Folk, though their hard lives often shorten their spans. They are considered adults by 18 and can live to be 90.

**Alignment.** Silt-Folk are inherently pragmatic and clannish. Their loyalty is to their community, not to any abstract code of law or chaos. Most are neutral, with a strong tendency toward good for their own people and a more ambiguous morality for outsiders.

**Size.** Silt-Folk are small and nimble, usually standing about 3 feet tall. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Water-Rat’s Luck.** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Seen Worse.** The Silt-Folk are not heroes, but they are unflappable survivors. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Chorus of the Commons.** You are constantly surrounded by the psychic murmur of your community’s collective wisdom. You have proficiency in the Insight skill. Additionally, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Insight) check made to determine if a creature is lying to you.

**The Gumbo Pot.** Your people know that survival is a communal effort. During a short or long rest, you can prepare a special, comforting meal for up to six creatures (including yourself). At the end of the rest, anyone who partook in the meal gains temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Lineage.** All Silt-Folk are survivors, but their environment shapes their methods. Choose one of the following lineages:

#### Hem-Dweller
You were born and raised in the Murky Hem, a master of the shifting tides and the secrets of the swamp.

*   **Swamp-Cunning.** You have a swimming speed of 25 feet, and you have advantage on any ability check made to navigate swampy or delta terrain.
*   **Lost in the Reeds.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, or other natural phenomena.

#### Manor-Rat
You grew up in the shadows of the Gilded, in the kitchens and servant’s quarters of the great manors. You are a master of social camouflage.

*   **Gilded Shadow.** You have proficiency in the Deception skill.
*   **Servant’s Intuition.** You have an uncanny knack for being where you are not supposed to be, without seeming out of place. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide or move silently within any occupied building.

Choose your home. Are you of the murky, honest waters of the Hem, or the polished, treacherous floors of the Manor? Either way, you are a Silt-Folk. You are the secret that everyone keeps, the silence that hears all. The Gilded Lords in their high towers think they are the players in the great game. They have no idea that you are the one who moves the pieces.
