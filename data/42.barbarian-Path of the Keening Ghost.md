Of course. Let us speak of the saddest of all the monsters. Let us speak of the ghost that does not rattle chains or scream for vengeance, but weeps silently in the attic of the soul. Let us speak of the Barbarian whose rage is not a fire, but a flood of tears, and whose strength is the terrible, beautiful strength of a broken heart.

## Chapter 3.5: Path of the Keening Ghost - A Sorrow Dressed in Fury

*“He beat upon the door, you see. Not with anger, but with a kind of desperate, rhythmic grief, as if he were trying to wake a lover who had died in her sleep. The wood splintered. The iron hinges screamed. We all stood there, in our silks and our fine tattoos, utterly silent. We were not afraid of his strength. We were afraid because, for the first time, we understood the awful size of his sorrow. And we knew, with a certainty that chilled the bourbon in our glasses, that the door was not the thing he was truly trying to break.”*
- **From the private journal of Lady Annabelle Moreau, describing her first encounter with a Keening Ghost.**

In the hushed, anxious theatre of the Sunken World, where every soul is a crowded room of ghosts, the Barbarian is the one whose house has the thinnest walls. They are the raw, nerve-ending of their lineage, their spirit a battleground for the loudest, most passionate of their ancestors. But not all great passions are of rage. Some of the most powerful, most enduring ghosts are not the warriors, but the mourners. They are the mothers who lost their children to the plague, the poets who died of a broken heart, the kings who watched their kingdoms crumble into the Fading, the lovers who were betrayed in the most final and unforgivable of ways.

These are the Keening Ghosts, and the Barbarian who walks their path is their chosen vessel.

The Path of the Keening Ghost is the great, tragic secret of the Barbarian class. Outsiders see the explosive force and mistake it for the simple, brutish fury of an Ash-Branded. They are wrong. This is not the hot, red fire of rage. It is the cold, blue, and bottomless ocean of grief. When this Barbarian enters their Fever, they are not possessed by a berserker; they are possessed by a banshee of their own bloodline. Their battle cry is not a roar of fury, but a wail of pure, heartbreaking sorrow, a sound so filled with the collected grief of their lineage that it can shatter a man’s courage and stop his heart.

To play a Keening Ghost is to be a creature of profound, dangerous sentimentality. You are a walking, breathing funeral in a world that is desperate to pretend it is at a party. Your strength is not the strength of muscle, but the terrible, unyielding strength of a soul that has already lost everything and has nothing left to fear but the silence that follows the scream.

### The Tragedy of Unspent Sorrow

The source of your power is a Chorus dominated by a sorrow so vast it has become a supernatural force. While other Barbarians are haunted by the glory of their ancestors, you are haunted by their grief. This Keening Ghost, or coalition of ghosts, does not scream for battle; it weeps for a world of lost things. It weeps for the Fading, for forgotten loves, for broken promises, for the simple, beautiful things that can never be again.

Your life is a constant, quiet struggle to contain this ocean of sorrow. You may appear unnaturally calm, serene, even detached. This is not peace. It is a levee, a desperately constructed wall against the rising tide. Your emotions, your own personal joys and sorrows, are a small and fragile village on the shore, and you live in constant, quiet terror of the flood.

But the tide always rises. A moment of personal loss, a beautiful song that reminds you of a forgotten love, the sight of an injustice that echoes one of your ancestor’s great tragedies—anything can cause the levee to break. This is your Fever. It is not a rage, but a **Deluge**.

In that moment, your own consciousness is swept away. The world dissolves into a grey, tear-blurred haze. The air grows cold, and the only sound is the high, terrible wail of your own voice, singing a song of pure, weaponized grief. In the Deluge, you do not feel anger. You feel a vast, and strangely liberating, sadness. You strike your enemies not with hatred, but with a kind of desperate, sorrowful pity, as if to say, "Let me show you the true shape of pain. Let me make you understand."

### The Mourner at the Feast: A Social Affliction

In the Gilded halls, where the maintenance of a pleasant façade is the highest virtue, you are an object of profound discomfort. You are the mourner at the wedding, the one whose very presence is a reminder of the Weary Truth that everyone else is desperately trying to drink away.

They treat you with a delicate, fearful sort of pity. They speak to you in hushed tones, as if you are perpetually on the verge of breaking down. They do not understand that your quietude is not fragility, but a feat of immense, exhausting strength. They mistake the levee for the shore.

This makes you a creature of profound loneliness. You feel things with a depth and purity that is alien to the cynical, mannered world around you. You may seek out the company of other wounded souls—the disgraced, the outcasts, the broken—or you may wrap yourself in a shroud of isolation, finding a strange comfort in the company of the weeping ghosts in your own blood.

### Creating a Keening Ghost Barbarian

Your character is a vessel for a beautiful and terrible sorrow. You are a poet whose only medium is violence, a mourner whose grief can level a house. When you build your character, ask yourself these deeply personal, sentimental questions:

*   **What is the source of your sorrow?** What is the great, original tragedy of your lineage that gave birth to your Keening Ghost? Was it a single, epic heartbreak, like a queen betrayed by her entire court? Or is it the slow, collected grief of a people who have lost their homeland to the Fading, like the Cypress Kin?
*   **What is the face of your ghost?** Who is the dominant voice in your Keening? Is it your grandmother, weeping for a child she lost to the swamp fever? Is it your great-uncle, a poet who killed himself for unrequited love? Knowing the story of your ghost will define the flavor of your sorrow.
*   **How do you carry your grief?** In the quiet times, when the levee is holding, what are you like? Are you perpetually sad, a creature of sighs and melancholy? Or are you the opposite, unnaturally cheerful, your laughter a little too loud, a desperate performance to keep the tears at bay?
*   **What is your breaking point?** What is the one thing that is guaranteed to unleash the Deluge? Is it the sight of a child in danger? The sound of a particular, sad song? A word that reminds you of a lost love? Knowing this is the key to your character’s greatest strength and their most terrible vulnerability.

### Path of the Keening Ghost: Class Features

You are a conduit for a sorrow so profound it has become a weapon. The features of this path allow you to channel the power of your Keening Ghost, turning your grief into a terrible, spectral force.

#### The Keening
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage becomes a manifestation of profound, ancestral grief. This is not a Rage, but a Deluge. When you enter this state, you do not roar; you unleash a psychic wail of pure sorrow.

Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you and that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A creature is not frightened by the sound itself, but by the sudden, overwhelming, and inexplicable wave of pure grief it carries, a glimpse into the heart of your personal, ancestral tragedy.

While you are in your Deluge, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to focus your sorrow. Choose one creature that is currently frightened of you. That creature must make another Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the frightened effect is extended until the end of your next turn.

#### Grave-Touched Empathy
At 6th level, your constant communion with the sorrowful dead has granted you a unique, morbid empathy. You have learned the language of grief.

You can cast the *speak with dead* spell, but only as a ritual. You do not need material components. When you cast it in this way, you are not animating the corpse’s spirit. Instead, you are attuning your own Chorus to the lingering sorrow and memory held within the bones, experiencing a fleeting, dream-like echo of the creature’s final moments and most profound regrets.

Additionally, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Insight) check made to discern the source of a creature’s sadness, grief, or hidden pain. You are an expert in heartbreak.

#### Heart of Sorrow
Starting at 10th level, your own soul has become so saturated with the epic grief of your lineage that the lesser fears and psychic intrusions of the world can find no purchase. There is simply no room for them.

You have resistance to psychic damage. Furthermore, you cannot be charmed or frightened by any means. If an effect would cause you to be charmed or frightened, it is immediately suppressed, though you feel a phantom echo of the emotion, a strange, hollow pang of a feeling that you can no longer truly experience.

#### Heartbreak’s Rebuke
At 14th level, your sorrow has become a potent, retaliatory weapon. Your grief is no longer just a shield; it is a shard of broken glass.

While you are in your Deluge, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make them feel the full, undiluted force of your Keening Ghost's original heartbreak. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).

On a failed save, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Barbarian level and is stunned until the end of its next turn. This is not a physical stunning; the creature is mentally and spiritually paralyzed, wracked by a sudden, overwhelming, and inexplicable vision of your ancestor's greatest loss, a grief so pure it short-circuits their own mind. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much psychic damage and is not stunned.

---

You are a Keening Ghost. You are the sorrow at the heart of the world, the beautiful, terrible truth that all things of beauty must fade. They will call you a monster, a madman, a creature of ill-omen. Let them. They are the ones who are afraid to feel. You have felt it all, the collected heartbreak of a hundred generations. And you have endured. In a world that is dying, your sorrow is not a weakness. It is a testament to what was lost. And it is a promise that it will never, ever be forgotten.
