Of course. Let us speak of the lifeblood of this world, the art that is both its salvation and its damnation. Here is a chapter on the nature of magic in the Sunken World, designed to stand within an award-winning tabletop role-playing game.

## Chapter 4: The Art of the Bleeding Past - Magic in the Sunken World

Sip your whiskey. The ice is melting fast in this heat. You’ve heard the stories, haven’t you? Tales of Gilded Lords whose skin shimmers with the light of a forgotten dawn, of Murk-Elves who command the swamp with a silent gesture, of Ash-Branded shamans who cage the fury of their own ancestors in fire and scars. You’ve heard of magic.

Do not make the mistake of thinking you understand it.

Magic in the Sunken World is not the clean, academic craft of other realms. It is not a science of formulae and components recited by rote. It is a haunting. It is a seance you conduct with your own blood. It is a ghost story you tell about yourself, with your skin as the page and your soul as the ink. To cast a spell is to commune with the dead, to borrow their strength, to relive their passions, and to risk being consumed by their sorrows. It is the art of the bleeding past, and it always, *always*, demands a price.

### The Nature of Marrow-Ink: The Medium of Memory

The source of all magic is the Heirloom, the living tapestry of tattoos that connects a Marked individual to their lineage. The medium for this art is **Marrow-Ink**, and it is no simple pigment. It is a psychoreactive substance, a physical medium for memory and spiritual essence. True Marrow-Ink is not made, but harvested from the deep, sorrowful places of the world where the past has left a physical stain on the present.

A Myth-Weaver’s inkpot might contain:

*   **Titan’s Blood:** Crystallized, ruby-dark ink harvested from the veins of slumbering, primordial beings deep beneath the earth. It carries a resonant, geological power and is favored by the Geodes.
*   **Harrow-Dust:** A fine, grey powder made from the ground-up soil of a great and tragic battlefield. It is thick with the echoes of sorrow, fear, and violent rage, often used in the Brands of the Ash-Branded.
*   **Memory-Lichen:** The phosphorescent fungi cultivated by the Cypress Kin, which feeds not on decaying wood, but on the psychic residue of the ancient swamp. It glows with a soft, melancholic light and carries the quiet, unending hum of their lineage.
*   **Anchored Essence:** The rarest and most coveted of all inks, distilled by Gilded Family alchemists from a piece of the world that is succumbing to the Fading. To use it is to steal a piece of reality—the color of a specific sunset, the song of a unique bird—and trap it in your skin.

When this ink is worked into the flesh by a master Myth-Weaver, it does more than create a picture. It becomes a conduit, an antenna tuned to the endless broadcast of your own history, allowing the voices of your Chorus to bleed into the present.

### The Chorus: The Engine of Magic

This is the great secret of spellcasting in the Sunken World: you are not the one casting the spell. An ancestor is casting it through you.

The Chorus—that collection of soul-fragments, memories, and skills that make up your Heirloom—is your true spellbook. Every spell you "know" or "prepare" is, in fact, the signature talent of a particular ancestor. You do not learn *Fireball*; you learn to call upon your great-great-aunt Elara, the Sky-Burner, whose rage was so great she could make the very air ignite. You do not prepare *Cure Wounds*; you attune yourself to the memory of your grandfather, the battlefield medic, whose gentle hands could soothe the most grievous of injuries.

This reframes the very nature of a spellcaster in Fifth Edition:

*   **Wizards (Myth-Weavers):** Are the scholars of the soul. They do not just learn spells; they are genealogists of magic. Their "spellbook" is a complex grimoire of ancestral charts, historical notes, and the intricate tattoo patterns required to properly channel a specific ancestor. Scribing a new spell is the act of researching a new branch of a bloodline and designing the Heirloom-conduit to access it.

*   **Clerics & Paladins (Chorus-Keepers & Oath-Sworn):** Do not worship distant gods. Their faith is placed in the collective power and ideals of their own lineage. Their "divine" power is the resonant might of a hundred generations of ancestors who held to a particular code or swore a specific oath. A Paladin's oath is a promise not just to themselves, but to the ghosts of every ancestor who swore it before them.

*   **Bards (Story-Spinners):** Are the masters of the Chorus. They do not just play music; they harmonize with the voices in their blood, weaving the stories of their ancestors into magical, resonant epics. Their Bardic Inspiration is a literal gift of an ancestor’s fleeting skill or courage.

*   **Druids & Rangers (Swamp-Wardens & Hunters):** Channel the ancestors who lived and died in harmony with the wild, their knowledge of nature not learned, but remembered. A Druid’s Wild Shape is the memory of an ancestor who formed a deep, symbiotic bond with a beast, allowing the Druid to borrow its form.

### Weaving the Heirloom: The Act of Spellcasting

To cast a spell in Mythos Tattoo is a physical, spiritual, and deeply personal act. It is called "Weaving," and it requires the caster to draw power from their own body, their own history. The components of a spell are not abstract requirements; they are the tangible keys that unlock the memories in your blood.

#### Verbal (V) Components: A Litany of the Dead
A Verbal component is not a string of arcane gibberish. It is a fragment of your own history, spoken aloud. To Weave a spell, you might:
*   Whisper the full name and title of the ancestor you are channeling ("Elara Moreau, the Sky-Burner, grant me your fury!").
*   Recite a line from a family poem or a verse from an old ancestral song.
*   Speak an oath that a particular ancestor swore ("As my grandfather defended the bridge, so shall I!").
A spell with a Verbal component cannot be cast in silence, for it is an act of calling to the dead, and the dead demand to be named.

#### Somatic (S) Components: Reading the Scars
A Somatic component is the act of physically interacting with your own Heirloom. The caster's hands are not merely waving in the air; they are tracing the intricate lines of their tattoos, "reading" the story on their skin to awaken its power.
*   To cast *Shield of Faith*, a Paladin might slam their fist over the Brand of the Unbroken Shield on their chest, causing the tattoo to flare with protective light.
*   To Weave an illusion, a Story-Spinner might run their fingers over the tattooed image of a cunning, trickster ancestor, drawing the lie from the ink.
*   A Myth-Weaver casting *Fly* might trace the sweeping lines of a great tattooed wing on their back.
A spell with a Somatic component requires a free hand, not just to gesture, but to touch, to trace, and to physically connect with the living history on your skin.

#### Material (M) Components: The Reliquary of the Soul
Material components are not just random bits of fungus and guano. They are objects of deep, personal, and ancestral significance. A spellcaster’s component pouch is a **"Reliquary,"** a collection of mementos, heirlooms, and symbolic items that resonate with the memories in their Chorus.
*   The pinch of graveyard dirt for *Feign Death* is not just any dirt; it must be taken from the grave of the specific ancestor whose memory of stillness you are channeling.
*   The tiny silver mirror for *Sanctuary* might be a locket containing a portrait of the beloved matriarch whose protective spirit you invoke.
*   A spell requiring a diamond worth 1,000 gp is not about the monetary value. It is about the weight of the sacrifice. That diamond might be the central stone from a great-grandmother’s wedding ring, its destruction an act that unleashes a profound and potent magic.
This makes the acquisition of material components a core part of the adventure. You don’t just buy them at a shop; you must find your ancestors’ graves, uncover lost heirlooms, and make meaningful sacrifices.

### The Schools of Magic: A Gilded Taxonomy

The academic schools of magic are a fiction created by River-Folk Myth-Weavers to impose a sense of order on the chaotic, narrative nature of their Heirlooms. In truth, the "schools" are simply a classification of ancestral legacies, the different flavors of power that a bloodline might carry.

*   **Abjuration - The Weight of the Oath:** Spells of protection, warding, and sealing. This magic is channeled from ancestors who were guardians, lawgivers, and protectors—those who swore binding oaths and died to uphold them.
*   **Conjuration - The Echo of Presence:** Spells of summoning and travel. This is the legacy of ancestors who were great travelers, who made pacts with the strange entities of the swamp, or whose will was so strong they could pull things from memory into reality.
*   **Divination - The Pattern of the Past:** Spells of prophecy and truth-seeing. This magic comes from the Chorus's vast, collective memory, allowing the caster to see the patterns of history and thereby predict the shape of the future. It is the legacy of scholars, seers, and gossips.
*   **Enchantment - The Tyranny of Personality:** Spells that charm and command. This is the raw, charismatic force of a legendary ancestor’s personality—a beloved leader, a terrifying tyrant, or a silver-tongued diplomat—made manifest.
*   **Evocation - The Echo of Ruin:** Spells of raw, destructive force. This is the memory of great, passionate power—the rage of the Ash-Branded demigods, the fury of a draconic ancestor, the sorrow of a Geode that shattered a mountain. It is the most dangerous and costly magic to wield.
*   **Illusion - The Perfumed Lie:** Spells of deception and phantom images. This is the legacy of tricksters, spies, actors, and every Gilded Lord or Lady who ever maintained their power through a flawless, beautiful performance.
*   **Necromancy - The Art of the Open Grave:** Spells of life, death, and undeath. This is the most literal and intimate form of Heirloom magic—the art of speaking directly to the dead in your blood, of borrowing their vitality or commanding their very essence. It is a dangerous and often corrupting practice.
*   **Transmutation - The Patient Craft:** Spells that alter the physical world. This is the legacy of the great artisans—the Geode stone-carvers, the Cypress Kin wood-shapers, the River-Folk alchemists—whose patient work was a form of magic in itself.

### The Cost of Power: Chorus Strain

The Chorus does not lend its power for free. Every time you Weave a spell, you open a door to the past, and you risk a ghost walking through it. The more powerful the spell, the wider you must open the door. This is represented by the **Chorus Strain** mechanic.

Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you must roll a d20. If the roll is equal to or lower than the level of the spell you cast, you suffer a Chorus Strain effect. The Chronicler can either choose an effect from the table below or roll a d6.

| d6 | Chorus Strain Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Ancestral Quirk.** The personality of the ancestor you channeled briefly surfaces. For the next hour, you gain a minor, harmless personality trait of that ancestor (e.g., a nervous tic, a particular accent, a craving for a specific food). |
| 2 | **Memory Bleed.** You experience a vivid, disorienting flashback to one of the ancestor's memories. You have disadvantage on the next ability check you make. |
| 3 | **Emotional Echo.** You are flooded with the ancestor's dominant emotion at the time they mastered this power (e.g., rage, sorrow, terror, pride). You have disadvantage on all Charisma and Wisdom saving throws until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | **Phantom Pain.** You feel a phantom echo of an old wound from the ancestor, perhaps the feeling of a blade in your side or a fire on your skin. You are considered poisoned for 1 minute. |
| 5 | **Partial Possession.** The ancestor’s will momentarily overwhelms your own. Until the end of your next turn, you must use your action to do what the ancestor would have done in this situation (as determined by the Chronicler). This might be to attack the nearest enemy, to protect a specific ally, or to preen with arrogant pride. |
| 6 | **The Open Grave.** The door swings wide. The Chronicler chooses a powerful ancestor from your Chorus. For the next minute, that ancestor is a dominant voice in your head. You gain a temporary flaw from that ancestor, and you might hear them whispering commands or criticisms. At the Chronicler's discretion, this could manifest as a more severe, short-term madness effect. |

This mechanic ensures that even the simplest spell is a gamble. It makes magic feel like the dangerous, personal, and costly art it is in the Sunken World.

### Forbidden Inks and the Unwritten Soul

Not all magic follows these rules. The **Chimera Cults** practice the forbidden art of mixing bloodlines, tattooing themselves with the Heirlooms of other Kin, creating a Chorus of warring ghosts that drives them mad but grants them terrifying, unpredictable power. The most powerful Gilded Lords practice **Anchoring**, a form of ritual magic that does not call on the past, but steals from the present, leaving the world a little greyer with every casting.

And then there are the **Blank-Skins**. With no Primal Mark and no Chorus, they are cut off from the magic of the past. Their souls are unwritten. This makes them terrifying, but it also gives them a unique potential. A Blank-Skin who seeks magic cannot look inward; they must look outward.
*   They might make a pact with one of the strange, ancient entities of the swamp, a being far older than any human ancestor, becoming a **Warlock**.
*   They might be born with a connection not to a bloodline, but to the raw, untamed Fading itself, their magic a chaotic and unpredictable force, making them a **Sorcerer**.
*   They might, through sheer, desperate intellect, learn to read the patterns of the dying world, to understand the deep grammar of decay, and to impose their will upon it, becoming a true **Wizard** in a world of haunted mediums.

These paths are rare, difficult, and often seen as heretical. They are the exception that proves the rule: that for the vast majority of the Sunken World, all magic is a ghost, all power is a memory, and every spell is an epitaph waiting to be written on your soul. What will yours say?
