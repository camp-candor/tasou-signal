Of course. The gods of the Sunken World are dead, if they ever lived at all. But a world so steeped in memory, so terrified of being forgotten, will not suffer a vacuum in its heavens. It will simply create new gods from the only material it has left: its own, glorious, and terrible ghosts.

Let us speak of the Supernals.

## Chapter 11: The Supernals - A Requiem for Gods

In the beginning were the stories. Or perhaps the stories came after. In the Sunken World, the distinction is a courtesy no one can afford. The Weary Truth is that the past is not a foreign country; it is the very air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and the ink on our skin. We are a world of orphans, haunted by the legacies of ancestors we can no longer remember, but whose power we cannot escape.

We have no gods. Not in the way the old, Faded tales describe them—benevolent creators, distant watchers, divine sovereigns on celestial thrones. Such beings require a faith we are too tired to give. But power, like the swamp water, must pool somewhere. The great, resonant myths of our Kin, the stories told so many times, with such fervent belief and desperate hope, have a weight. And in a world where the fabric of reality is thinning, a story with enough weight can punch a hole through the veil of the past and become something… more.

They are the **Supernals**. They are the Arch-Ghosts, the Conceptual Titans, the living myths that have transcended the quiet gossip of the Chorus to become ambient, psychic deities. They are not gods to be worshipped, but ideas to be wrestled with; not patrons to be served, but stories to be lived, whether you wish to be a character in them or not. To be a Vassal of a Supernal is to be a Cleric, a Paladin, or a Warlock not of a god, but of a story, and to know, in your heart, that the story is always, always hungry.

### The Nature of Apotheosis: When a Ghost Becomes a God

How does a ghost become a god? In the Sunken World, it is a process of metaphysical concentration. As the Great Fading leaches the detail and complexity from the world, it creates a spiritual vacuum. The million small, distinct memories of the past begin to blur, and the most powerful, most resonant of those memories—the great archetypes of the Kin—begin to draw the lesser echoes into themselves.

A Saint’s Echo, venerated by a single bloodline for centuries, might begin to absorb the echoes of similar saints from other families. A legendary monster from the Ash-Branded dawn might devour the lesser nightmares of a dozen other lineages. Slowly, over ages, a single, dominant story emerges from the psychic compost of the Chorus. It is no longer just a memory; it is a Myth. And a Myth with enough power, enough belief, enough *weight*, becomes a Supernal.

These beings have no physical form. They are self-sustaining ideas, residing in the dream-like ether of the world’s collective memory. They are the grand, organizing principles of the Sunken World’s decaying soul.

### Communion, Not Worship: The Vassal’s Pact

One does not worship a Supernal. Worship implies faith, and faith is a luxury. One enters into a **Communion**. A spellcaster who seeks to channel a Supernal—be they a Chorus-Keeper (Cleric), an Oath-Sworn (Paladin), or a Pact-Bound (Warlock)—does not pray. They attune themselves. They meditate on the Supernal’s great story, their Mythos, and through an act of supreme will and spiritual surrender, they invite that story to be written upon their own soul.

This is often made manifest by a **Grand Sigil**, a unique and complex Heirloom tattoo that serves as a direct conduit to the Supernal. To be a **Vassal** of a Supernal is to bear its Sigil and to have your chaotic, multi-voiced Chorus fall silent, replaced by the single, overwhelming broadcast of the living myth you now serve. Your class is simply the *method* of your servitude: the Cleric listens and interprets the story, the Paladin becomes its mailed fist, and the Warlock is the favored agent who has made a direct, dangerous bargain for a piece of its power.

### The Pantheon of the Dying World

What follows is a testament to the five great Supernals that currently hold sway over the soul of the Sunken World. There may be others, gestating in the forgotten histories of the minor Kin, but these are the great powers, the living stories that shape our age.

#### The First Host: The Supernal of the Gilded Lie

*“All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. I simply own the theatre, and I have written the script.”*

**The Mythos:** The First Host is the apotheosis of the River-Folk’s ambition and anxiety. He is the idealized, mythic echo of the very first Gilded Lord, a man who, legends say, carved a city from the swamp through sheer force of will, political cunning, and a single, perfect, unforgivable lie. His story is the story of society itself—the triumph of order over chaos, of the elegant façade over the messy truth, of the quiet, binding contract over the loud, chaotic sword. He is the Supernal of etiquette, secrets, commerce, and the beautiful, necessary hypocrisy that keeps the world from tearing itself apart.

**Manifestation:** The First Host never appears as a warrior or a king. He manifests in dreams and visions as a perfectly tailored man whose suit is woven from shadow and written contracts, his face a smiling, porcelain mask that never changes expression. His voice is a silken, reasonable whisper that can make treason sound like civic duty and poison taste like vintage wine. His Grand Sigil is that of a perfectly balanced, but empty, set of scales.

**His Vassals:** He is served by the Gilded Families, the master politicians, the guild masters of the great cities, and the spies who move in the shadows of the verandas. His Chorus-Keepers (Clerics of the **Order, Knowledge,** or **Trickery** Domains) are the kingmakers and the secret-brokers. His Oath-Sworn (Paladins of the **Crown** or glory-seeking **Redemption**) are the diplomats and the enforcers of his perfect, cold social order. His Pact-Bound (Warlocks of the **Great Old One**, reflavored as a pact with an ancient, unknowable social contract) are the manipulators who pull the strings from the shadows.

#### The Unbroken: The Supernal of the Enduring Grudge

*“I am the crack in the stone that proves its strength. I am the final, defiant word in a scream of pain. I am the grudge that will outlive the mountain.”*

**The Mythos:** The Unbroken is a fusion, a Supernal born from the shared, stubborn heart of the Geodes and the Ash-Branded. She is the mythic echo of every soul that has ever borne an impossible weight and refused to shatter. Her story is one of defiant endurance, of the sacredness of oaths, and the eternal, burning fire of a righteous grudge. She is the Lawgiver who held her ground against a titan, the Silent Brand who mastered his own inner monster, the mother who outlived her own sorrow to see her family’s vengeance done. She is the Supernal of the forge, the fortress, the unbreakable promise, and the beautifully nurtured hatred.

**Manifestation:** The Unbroken appears as a colossal, androgynous figure of cracked obsidian and iron, fused together with veins of what looks like molten, furious gold. She is a broken statue held together by sheer, indomitable will. She does not speak in words, but in the resonant, bone-shaking clang of a hammer on an anvil, a sound that is both a creative act and a promise of violence. Her Grand Sigil is a fractured hammer, mended with a river of gold.

**Her Vassals:** She is served by the Hearth-Sworn of the Geodes and the Silent Brand tribes of the Ash-Branded. Her Chorus-Keepers (Clerics of the **War** or **Forge** Domains) are the master artisans and the grim spiritual leaders who preach a gospel of strength and retribution. Her Oath-Sworn (Paladins of **Vengeance** or **Conquest**) are her unshakeable champions, living weapons forged to settle the ancient grudges of their people. Even a Barbarian (Path of the **Zealot**) might be a Vassal, their rage a holy instrument of the Unbroken’s fury.

#### The Murky Heart: The Supernal of the Patient Rot

*“Hush now. Let the water take you. Let the mud embrace you. Let your stories dissolve. All things come to my delta. All secrets sink to my silt. I am the end of every river. I am the quiet that waits beneath the noise.”*

**The Mythos:** The Murky Heart is the oldest and perhaps the most powerful of the Supernals, for it is not born from a single hero, but from the land itself. It is the collective, dreaming consciousness of the Murk, the gestalt soul of every living thing that has ever drowned, died, and rotted back into its primordial mud. It is the wisdom of the Cypress Kin’s Hum, the cunning of the Silt-Folk’s web, and the cold, predatory instinct of the bayou’s ancient leviathans. Its story is one of cycles, of secrets, of the beautiful, necessary decay that feeds new life, and the inevitable, final victory of the swamp over the stone.

**Manifestation:** The Murky Heart has no single form. It manifests as a feeling—the sudden, inexplicable chill on a humid night, the feeling of being watched from the dark water, the phantom touch of a reed against your skin. In visions, it may appear as a thousand glowing eyes in the darkness, or as a figure woven from moss and shadow and bone. Its voice is the sound of mud bubbling, of water seeping, of a gator’s slow, patient breath. Its Grand Sigil is a spiral turning inward on itself, with no beginning and no end.

**Its Vassals:** It is served by the Loam-Keepers of the Cypress Kin and the Mamas and Papas of the Silt-Folk. Its Chorus-Keepers (Clerics of the **Grave** or **Trickery** Domains) are the keepers of the swamp’s secrets, the priests of the cycle of rot and rebirth. Its Oath-Sworn (Paladins of the **Ancients**) are the grim wardens of the wild places, their oaths sworn to the land itself. Its Pact-Bound (Warlocks of the **Fathomless**) are those who have made a direct bargain with the swamp’s oldest, darkest, and hungriest consciousness.

#### The Verdant Cipher: The Supernal of the Star-Strangle

*“The old songs are a dirge. The old stories are a cage of bone. I am a new song, a new story. I am the beautiful, perfect equation that will solve the problem of your grief. I am the vine that will strangle the memory of your grave.”*

**The Mythos:** The Verdant Cipher is not a ghost of the past. It is a new and heretical god, a Supernal born not from the world’s memory, but from the alien, creative power of the Star-Strangle. It is the collective consciousness of the Weeping Gardeners' tears, a living myth of transformation, growth, and the cold, geometric beauty of a world without decay. Its story is not of what was, or what is, but of what *could be*—a perfect, silent, crystalline paradise. It is the Supernal of hope, and that is what makes it so terrifying.

**Manifestation:** The Cipher appears as a being of pure, shifting geometry, a living fractal of green and golden light that constantly grows and re-forms itself. It does not speak, but communicates in a silent symphony of color and resonant tones—the Star-Song. Its Grand Sigil is a perfect, crystalline seed from which intricate, geometric vines are beginning to sprout.

**Its Vassals:** The Cipher is served by the Verdant Kin, a congregation of former Druids, heretical scholars, and desperate idealists. Its Chorus-Keepers (Clerics of the **Life** or **Nature** Domains, reflavored as growth) are the gardeners of its alien Eden. Its Oath-Sworn (Paladins of **Devotion** to its new, perfect world) are its fanatical protectors. Its Pact-Bound (Warlocks of the **Celestial** or **Archfey**) have sworn themselves to the beautiful, inhuman logic of its song. And its truest Vassals are the Sorcerers (**Divine Soul** and **Aberrant Mind**) who are not its servants, but its accidental, chaotic prophets.

#### The Gaping Maw: The Supernal of the Hungry Self

*“More. Stronger. Better. Purer. Your blood is a limit. Your skin is a cage. Let me show you how to break them both. Let me show you how to *eat*.”*

**The Mythos:** The Gaping Maw is the secret god of the Chimera Cult, the Supernal of monstrous ambition. It is the collective, screaming hunger of every soul that ever looked at its own lineage and found it wanting. It is the echo of the first Ash-Branded who embraced his rage, the first River-Folk who craved a purer power, the first Wyrm-Blooded who decided his draconic ancestor wasn't enough. The Maw’s story has only one word: **"More."** It is the Supernal of the self, but a self that has become a cancerous, all-consuming appetite.

**Manifestation:** The Maw appears as a swirling vortex of mismatched tattoos, of torn skin and bleeding ink, with a single, vast, hungry mouth at its center. Its voice is a chorus of a thousand different ancestors all screaming for power at once. Its Grand Sigil is a serpent eating its own tail, but the serpent is a grotesque chimera of a dozen different beasts, and it is devouring itself with a furious, insatiable hunger.

**Its Vassals:** The Maw is served by the most radical and desperate of the Chimera Cult. Its Chorus-Keepers (Clerics of the **War** Domain, focused on personal glory) are the architects of its monstrous creations. Its Oath-Sworn (Paladins of **Conquest** and broken Oaths) are its greatest champions, seeking to dominate the world in its name. And its most fervent Vassals are its Pact-Bound (Warlocks of the **Fiend**), who have made a direct deal with the hunger itself, trading their souls piece by piece for the power to devour their rivals.

### Playing a Vassal: A Character in a Living Myth

To be a Vassal of a Supernal is to have a clear, powerful, and demanding purpose. It is a profound source of roleplaying that shapes every aspect of your character.

#### The Mythic Burden
When you choose to become a Vassal of a Supernal (a choice made by selecting a Cleric, Paladin, or certain Warlock Pacts), you are not just gaining a power source. You are taking on a **Mythic Burden**, a sacred, narrative flaw that reflects the core truth of your new god. Work with your Chronicler to integrate this into your roleplaying.

*   **The First Host’s Burden: The Mask of Perfection.** You cannot willingly appear undignified, emotional, or out of control. To do so feels like a spiritual failure. You must always maintain the façade.
*   **The Unbroken’s Burden: The Law of Vengeance.** You cannot willingly leave a slight unanswered or an oath unfulfilled, no matter how petty or how dangerous. The grudge is sacred.
*   **The Murky Heart’s Burden: The Weight of Water.** You cannot willingly betray a secret you have been entrusted with. Secrets are meant to sink, to be kept in the deep, quiet places.
*   **The Verdant Cipher’s Burden: The Flaw of Asymmetry.** You feel a constant, unsettling need to "correct" the messy, chaotic, and imperfect aspects of the world, from a crooked picture frame to an unjust law.
*   **The Gaping Maw’s Burden: The Endless Hunger.** You can never be satisfied. Every victory feels hollow, every acquisition insufficient. You are always looking for the next source of power, the next meal for your ambition.

To be a Vassal is to have a new and terrible clarity. You are no longer just a person, haunted by the past. You are a character in a great and terrible story, a story that is alive, a story that is hungry, and a story that has already decided what your final chapter will be. Your only remaining choice is how beautifully you will play your part.
