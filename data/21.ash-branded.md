Of course. Let us now travel away from the murky delta and the Gilded cities, out past the edges of the Faded Lands. Our journey takes us to the cracked, grey plains of ash and cinder, a landscape scarred by a history so violent it has poisoned the very soil. Here, in this desolate theatre of survival, we find the most feared and misunderstood of all the Kin: the Ash--Branded.

## Chapter 3.5: The Ash-Branded - The Caged Fury

*“The River-Folk nobleman fears the beast in the swamp. The Geode fears the flaw in the stone. The Murk-Elf fears the loss of self. We? We fear the hero in our blood. For we know that when he awakens, he will burn the world down just to feel the warmth.”*
- **Kaelen, Scourged Kin Outcast, explaining a tribal proverb.**

On the desolate frontiers of the Sunken World, where the slow rot of the Fading gives way to a stark and brutal emptiness, live the Ash-Branded. To the other Kin, they are the Scourged, the monsters at the edge of the map, the orcs of this sorrowful age. They are seen as savage brutes, their history a litany of blood and fire, their Heirlooms a gallery of nightmares. The stories told in Gilded nurseries are of Ash-Branded reavers, their scarred skin thick with tattoos of screaming monsters, their tusks stained with the blood of the innocent.

This fearful caricature, like all things in the Sunken World, is a profound and tragic misreading. The Ash-Branded are not monsters. They are the wardens of monsters, and the monsters are their own ancestors. Their infamous rage is not a weapon; it is a shield. Their brutal traditions are not a sign of savagery, but a desperate, centuries-long effort to cage a fury so profound it threatens to unmake them from within.

To play an Ash-Branded is to be at war with your own blood. It is to walk a razor’s edge between a stoic, iron-willed self-control and the glorious, terrifying release of a legacy that longs for nothing more than to burn. It is a story of atonement for sins you did not commit, and the search for a moment of peace in a soul that knows only conflict.

### The Ashen Plains: A Land Scoured by History

The homeland of the Ash-Branded is a testament to the violence of their lineage. The Ashen Plains are not a natural desert. They are the scarred and cauterized remnants of a forgotten age of glory. Ages ago, their ancestors were not savages, but demigods. They were heroes of epic proportion, their Chorus a symphony of glorious, terrible power. They were the original Chimera Cultists, warriors who sought to transcend their mortal limits by tattooing themselves with the myths of the most powerful and chaotic creatures in existence. They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, and in doing so, they doomed their descendants forever.

Their power was so great, their passions so immense, that their wars were not mere battles; they were geological events. They raised mountains and shattered them. They boiled rivers and drank them dry. Their rage was a fire that melted stone, and their sorrow a grief that salted the earth. The Ashen Plains are the ruin they left behind, a world scoured clean of life and color by the sheer, unrestrained power of their own Heirlooms.

The Ash-Branded of today are the inheritors of this terrible power, and they live in the ruin it created. Their world is one of stark survival. The air is thin and smells of old smoke. The ground is grey and cracked, and the only things that grow are tough, thorny scrub-bushes and the resilient, pallid "ghost-bloom" flowers that feed on the lingering psychic residue of their ancestors' rage.

### The Cacophony of Ruin: The Screaming Chorus

If a River-Folk’s Chorus is a dysfunctional family dinner and a Cypress Kin’s is a monotonous hum, the Chorus of an Ash-Branded is a full-throated, blood-soaked Viking battle-hymn sung by a choir of mad gods. It is not a collection of whispers; it is a **Scream**.

The ancestors of the Ash-Branded were not people; they were forces of nature. Their soul-fragments are not gentle guides; they are ravenous, power-hungry tyrants who despise the quiet, diminished world their descendants inhabit. They crave the glorious violence of the past and constantly push their host toward conflict, toward passion, toward any act that will let them feel alive again, even for a moment.

The constant, internal struggle of an Ash-Branded is to silence this Scream. Their culture is a complex system of spiritual and psychological defenses built to suppress their own heritage. This is the source of their infamous, explosive rage. It is not, as outsiders believe, a surrender to their violent nature. It is a desperate act of self-preservation. By unleashing their own, personal fury in a controlled (or sometimes, uncontrolled) burst, they can momentarily drown out the Scream of the Chorus, creating a brief, blissful moment of mental silence. It is a dangerous, addictive, and often destructive form of therapy. A Barbarian’s Rage is not a battle-cry; it is a primal scream aimed inward.

### The Brand of the Beast: An Heirloom of Scars

The Ash-Branded Heirloom is a brutal and honest reflection of their inner turmoil. They do not trust the fluid beauty of ink. Their tattoos are **Brands**, applied through a ritual of fire, hot iron, and scarification known as the **"Caging."**

The process is an ordeal, a physical manifestation of their spiritual war. A young Ash-Branded is not given a tattoo to grant them power, but to bind a specific, particularly loud ancestral voice. The Myth-Weaver of a tribe, known as a **"Cage-Warden,"** will identify the most dangerous ancestor screaming in the youth’s blood—perhaps a berserker known as the "Red-Handed," or a sorcerer called the "Sky-Burner." The Warden will then design a Brand that represents a cage, a chain, or a ward against that specific entity. The Brand is then burned into the youth’s flesh in a ceremony of pain and endurance.

The Brand does not grant power in the traditional sense. It *leashes* it. The Ash-Branded warrior with the Brand of the Chimera on his back can, in a moment of desperation, tap into the monstrous strength of his ancestor. But the Brand itself is a source of constant, low-grade pain, a physical reminder of the cage he must maintain. The more Brands one has, the more powerful ancestors they have leashed, but also the more scarred and tormented they become.

The most revered figures in Ash-Branded society are the **"Silent Ones"**—not to be confused with the elven elders of the same name. These are individuals so covered in Brands, their skin a raised, keloid tapestry of cages and wards, that they have almost entirely silenced the Scream. They are figures of immense, stoic self-control, their faces calm masks that hide a lifetime of unimaginable inner conflict. They are the saints of this brutal faith, their scars a testament to their victory over their own blood.

### A Culture of Iron and Bone: The Way of the Leash

The society of the Ash-Branded is tribal, spartan, and bound by a complex code of ritualized self-control. Every aspect of their culture is designed to promote discipline and to bleed off the pressure of the Scream in controlled ways.

**The Ritual of the Spar:** Combat is not for conquest, but for catharsis. The Ash-Branded frequently engage in ritualized, non-lethal sparring matches. These are brutal affairs of bone-cracking force, but they are governed by strict rules. It is a way for warriors to unleash a controlled burst of their rage, to honor the battle-lust of their Chorus without succumbing to it.

**The Naming of the Voice:** An Ash-Branded will often give a name to the most dominant voice in their Scream. This act of personification is a way of externalizing the struggle. A warrior might speak of their struggle with "Old Iron-Tusk" as if he were a separate person, a constant, unwelcome companion. This allows them to seek advice from others on how to manage their "Voice" and creates a sense of communal struggle against a shared enemy.

**The Art of the Plains:** Ash-Branded art is one of stark, minimalist beauty. They carve intricate patterns into bone and stone, create haunting, percussive music on massive drums made of hide and iron, and compose epic, guttural poems that tell the stories of their ancestors—not as heroes to be emulated, but as cautionary tales of power run rampant. Their art is a way of honoring the power of their lineage while simultaneously containing it within the rigid structures of rhythm, rhyme, and form.

### Playing an Ash-Branded Character

To play an Ash-Branded is to be a pressure cooker, a storm held in a bottle. You are a figure of immense potential power, but that power is a curse. Your personal journey is one of self-mastery, of finding a balance between the person you are and the monster you carry inside you.

*   **The Exiled Seeker:** You have been cast out from your tribe, perhaps because you lost control one too many times, or perhaps because you refused a Brand that would have caged a part of you that you secretly cherish. You now wander the wider world, an object of fear and suspicion, seeking a new way to manage the Scream—perhaps through the disciplined meditation of a Geode Hearth, the quiet resignation of a Cypress Kin grove, or the dangerous, memory-devouring inks of the River-Folk.

*   **The Cage-Warden’s Apprentice:** You are a Myth-Weaver, a student of the sacred and painful art of the Caging. You have a deeper understanding of the Chorus than most, and you see the true nature of the Heirlooms in all the Kin. You might be on a quest for a "silent" material—a legendary stone or wood—that can be used to create Brands that don’t just cage the ancestors, but soothe them.

*   **The Redeemed:** Your lineage is not one of mere berserkers, but of a truly infamous monster, a tyrant whose crimes are still spoken of in horrified whispers by the other Kin. You are burdened not just with the Scream, but with the active, malevolent will of this specific ancestor. Your life is a constant battle against their influence, and your quest is one of atonement. You seek to use the terrible power you carry to undo the damage your ancestor caused, a desperate attempt to bring honor to a bloodline that has known only shame.

*   **The Voice-Tamer:** Unlike most of your Kin, you do not seek to silence the Scream. You seek to understand it. You believe that the ancestors are not just monsters, but fractured, wounded beings. You are a shaman, a diplomat to the dead. You enter into trances, walking the scarred landscape of your own soul, trying to reason with, to bargain with, and to heal the raging ghosts of your bloodline. It is a path that will either lead to a new form of harmony or to total madness.

### Ash-Branded Traits

Your Ash-Branded character has the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** The Ash-Branded mature quickly, a legacy of their violent past. They are considered adults by age 14. Their constant internal struggle puts an immense strain on their bodies, and few live past 60.

**Alignment.** The Ash-Branded’s culture of strict self-control pushes them toward lawful alignments, while the chaotic Scream within constantly tempts them toward chaos. They are a people defined by the war between Law and Chaos, and most fall somewhere into neutrality.

**Size.** Ash-Branded are powerfully built, often standing over 6 feet tall with broad, muscular frames. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Relentless Endurance.** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**The Caged Scream.** The constant pressure of your Chorus has forged your will into iron. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

**Menacing.** You have a physically imposing presence that reflects the barely-contained power within you. You are considered one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

**Lineage.** All Ash-Branded fight an internal war, but the nature of their cage defines their strategy. Choose one of the following lineages:

#### Silent Brand
You follow the traditional path of your people, seeking to master your inner fury through discipline and iron will. Your body is a testament to the cages you have built.

*   **Iron Mind.** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
*   **Controlled Fury.** When you use your Relentless Endurance feature, you can choose to unleash a controlled burst of your ancestor’s rage. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Scarred Soul
You have been broken by your Scream one too many times. Your body and soul are scarred, but through this breaking, you have gained a more intimate, if dangerous, connection to your ancestors' power.

*   **Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
*   **Embrace the Voice.** You can choose to temporarily loosen the cage. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of heightened power for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a bonus to your damage rolls with melee weapon attacks equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
***The Chronicler's Price:*** Each time you use Embrace the Voice, you risk one of your ancestors taking control. The Chronicler may ask you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you are subject to a short-term madness effect, as the ancestor's personality briefly overwhelms your own.

Choose your path. Will you be the Silent Brand, a master of control, your will a fortress against the storm within? Or will you be the Scarred Soul, dancing on the edge of madness, wielding a power that threatens to consume you? Either way, you are Ash-Branded. The ghosts of heroes are screaming in your blood. The world fears you. You fear yourself. This is the heart of your struggle, and the forge in which your legend will be shaped.
