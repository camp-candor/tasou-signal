Of course. Let us speak of the most scandalous of hauntings, the ghost story that refuses to stay a whisper, the one that tears its way into the flesh and wears its monstrous truth for all the world to see. Let us speak of the beautiful, terrible ruin of the Corrupted Heirloom.

## Chapter 3.5: Path of the Corrupted Heirloom - A Walking, Breathing Scandal

*“They whisper about me on their verandas, you know. They call me the ‘Moreau Anomaly.’ They say I am a stain on the family name, a grotesque mingling of good blood and bad. They are right, of course. But what they fail to understand, as they sip their iced tea and fan their sweating faces, is that a stain is the most honest thing in this whole damned house. It is a testament that something, at least, was truly *felt*. Something was spilled. And it cannot be wiped away.”*
- **Jean-Baptiste Moreau, last of the Bayou deSoto line, polishing a horn that had grown from his own temple.**

In the stifling, mannered parlors of the Sunken World, the greatest sin is not cruelty, nor greed, nor even murder. The greatest sin is a lack of discretion. It is the failure to maintain the beautiful, porcelain façade of the Gilded Lie. It is to allow the messy, violent, and inconvenient truths of the blood to spill out onto the clean floor for all to see.

The Barbarian who follows the Path of the Corrupted Heirloom is this sin, made flesh.

They are a walking, breathing scandal. While other Barbarians are haunted by a pure, if deafening, strain of their own lineage, the Corrupted Heirloom is a vessel for a spiritual mutt, a psychic gumbo of warring and unnatural ghosts. They are the living proof of a secret best left buried: a forbidden union between Kin, a heretical experiment by the Chimera Cult, or the catastrophic failure of a pact with a thing that should never have been bargained with. Their Heirloom is not a proud tapestry; it is a chaotic, stitched-together quilt of clashing legacies, and their flesh is the threadbare cloth that is tearing at the seams.

Their tragedy is not the struggle for control, like the Ash-Branded. Their tragedy is that they have nothing pure to control. Their soul is not a fortress under siege by a single army, but a city square overrun by a dozen different mobs, all screaming in different languages. To be a Corrupted Heirloom is to be a beautiful ruin, a living testament to a family’s greatest shame, and your rage is the sound of your own foundations crumbling.

### The Nature of the Corruption

A Corrupted Heirloom is a spiritual contamination, an unnatural blending of ancestral echoes that were never meant to mingle. This is not the careful, artistic hybridization of a master Flesh-Stitcher, but a chaotic, violent collision of legacies. The source of this corruption is always a secret, a story the family refuses to tell, a ghost they have tried to wall up in the cellar of their history.

*   **The Forbidden Union:** The most common source. Two Gilded Families might have a bitter rivalry, but a secret, passionate affair between their children produced an heir. Or, more scandalously, a Gilded scion may have run away with a Murk-Elf, a Geode, or even one of the feared Ash-Branded. The child of such a union is born with two warring Choruses in their blood. Their Heirloom is a battlefield where two histories are locked in a death-struggle, and their body is the contested ground.
*   **The Failed Experiment:** Perhaps an ancestor, desperate for power, sought out the Chimera Cult. But the Flesh-Stitcher was a hack, or the procedure was a failure. The ancestor was left not with a perfected, monstrous form, but a chaotic, unstable mess of grafted legacies. This spiritual cancer has been passed down the bloodline, a genetic disease of the soul that manifests in their descendants as the Corrupted Fever.
*   **The Devoured Legacy:** Sometimes, the corruption comes from a single, monstrous source. An ancestor may have made a pact with a primordial Bayou Leviathan, or been bitten by a great and terrible beast of the swamp. The creature’s spirit, its "Loam-Whisper," did not just influence them; it infected their Chorus, devouring their ancestral ghosts and replacing them with its own primal, monstrous instincts. Their descendants are now haunted not by people, but by the hungry ghost of a monster.

### The Fevered Metamorphosis: A Rage of the Flesh

For the Corrupted Heirloom, the Fever is not just a mental possession; it is a **Metamorphosis**. It is a grotesque and often painful physical transformation. When the dam of their self-control breaks, the warring ghosts in their blood do not just scream for dominance—they tear their way into reality, forcing their host’s body to become a temporary, monstrous chimera.

The skin splits and reforms. Bones pop and reset. The elegant lines of their Gilded Heirloom are warped and twisted by the brutal, scar-like Brands of an Ash-Branded ancestor, or the glowing, fungal patterns of a Murk-Elf. It is the ultimate act of indiscretion, the body itself broadcasting the family’s dirty laundry in a language of horn and claw and chitin.

This transformation is a source of immense power, but also of profound shame and alienation. In that moment, the Barbarian is no longer human, no longer even a pure-blooded member of their own Kin. They are an *it*, a monster, a grotesque spectacle that validates every fear and prejudice the polite world holds. And in the quiet, aching moments after the Metamorphosis recedes, they are left with the physical and spiritual scars of having been a stranger in their own skin.

### A Walking Scandal: The Social Outcast

To be a Corrupted Heirloom is to be the living embodiment of a family’s failure. Your very existence is an embarrassment.

In the Gilded halls, you are the "Moreau Anomaly," the "deSoto Shame." You are treated with a cloying, suffocating politeness that is sharper than any blade. You are invited to the parties, but always seated at the far end of the table. Your potential suitors are mysteriously called away on urgent business. You are a ghost at your own family’s feast, a constant, uncomfortable reminder of a story they are desperately trying to forget.

Among the common folk, you are a thing of fear and superstition. You are the boogeyman, the child of a forbidden pact, the one whose touch can curdle the milk. They make signs to ward off your "bad blood" and whisper that your presence will draw the attention of the things that live in the swamp.

This leaves you profoundly alone, a creature caught between worlds, belonging to none. Your struggle is not just against the monsters in your blood, but against a world that refuses to see the person behind the monstrous potential.

### Creating a Corrupted Heirloom Barbarian

Your character is a living contradiction, a creature of both noble blood and monstrous potential. When you build your character, ask yourself these questions, rooted in the tragic sentimentality of the Sunken World:

*   **What is the secret of your birth?** Work with your Chronicler to define the source of your corruption. Are you the product of a secret love affair, a failed ritual, or a monstrous curse? This secret is your greatest vulnerability and your most powerful motivation.
*   **What is the shape of your monster?** What are the dominant, warring legacies in your blood? Are you a Gilded scion haunted by an Ash-Branded berserker? A Geode whose stony flesh is warped by the patient rot of the Cypress Kin? This will define the flavor of your transformations.
*   **What is your relationship with your own skin?** Do you hate your monstrous potential, seeking a way to purify your bloodline and become "clean" again? Or have you embraced it, finding a brutal honesty in your grotesque form that you cannot find in the perfumed lies of the Gilded?
*   **Who knows your secret?** And what do they want from you? Is there a rival family that holds the proof of your "impure" birth, using it as blackmail? Is there a Chimera Cultist who sees you as their magnum opus, and wishes to "perfect" their work?

### Path of the Corrupted Heirloom: Class Features

You are a vessel for a cacophony of warring legacies, and your body is the battleground. The features of this path represent your ability to survive, and even weaponize, the monstrous transformation of your Fever.

#### Manifest Corruption
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage becomes a physical and grotesque metamorphosis. When you enter your Rage, your body transforms, manifesting a monstrous new feature. You choose one of the following manifestations. This feature lasts until your rage ends.

*   **Gator-Maw:** Your jaw unhinges and splits, your teeth sharpening into rows of reptilian fangs. The ghostly echo of a great Bayou Leviathan or a primordial beast from your Chorus surfaces. You can use your bonus action to make a special bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack that uses Strength for its attack and damage rolls. It deals 1d8 piercing damage. On a hit, you can attempt to grapple the target as part of the same bonus action.
*   **Kudzu Sinews:** Thorny, kudzu-like vines, thick as a man’s wrist, sprout from your back and arms, writhing with a hungry, unnatural life. These are the echoes of a Loam-Keeper ancestor or perhaps the Star-Strangle itself. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple. Additionally, your reach with melee attacks and for the purpose of grappling increases by 5 feet.
*   **Stone-Shell Carapace:** Your skin cracks and thickens, hardening into a chitinous, shell-like carapace that resembles a Geode's stony flesh or the armor of a great swamp beetle. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC, and you gain resistance to either piercing or slashing damage (your choice when you enter your rage).

#### Monstrous Adaptation
By 6th level, the constant transformations have left a permanent mark on your physiology. Your body has begun to adapt, taking on a minor but constant trait from one of your warring legacies. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

*   **Amphibious Form:** You adapt to the swampy legacy in your blood. You can breathe both air and water, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
*   **Scrambling Claws:** Your hands are tipped with rough, calloused claws, a gift from a beastly or subterranean ancestor. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
*   **Pouncing Vigor:** The predatory instinct of a great cat or wolf echoes in your muscles. Your long jump is up to 25 feet and your high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

#### Vengeful Blood
At 10th level, the very substance of your body has become a weapon. Your blood is an acrid, unnatural cocktail of warring spiritual energies, and it lashes out when spilled. When you take piercing or slashing damage from a creature within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to spray them with your own monstrous blood. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 acid or poison damage (your choice, representing the dominant "flavor" of your corruption) and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not poisoned.

#### Chimera’s Fury
Starting at 14th level, the chaos within you can no longer be contained by a single form. Your Fever now unleashes a full, terrifying metamorphosis, a true chimera of your warring legacies. When you use your **Manifest Corruption** feature, you can choose to manifest two of the listed benefits simultaneously. For example, you could have both the Gator-Maw and the Stone-Shell Carapace, becoming a monstrous, biting juggernaut.

---

You are a Corrupted Heirloom. You are the inconvenient truth, the family secret that learned how to fight. You are a creature of profound loneliness, your own skin a foreign country. The world may see you as a monster, a grotesque failure of breeding. But in the heart of your Fever, as your body breaks and reforms into a thing of terrible, honest power, you will know a truth that the Gilded Lords can never comprehend: it is better to be a true monster than a false man. It is better to be a beautiful ruin than a perfect, empty house.
