Of course. Let us draw back the mosquito netting, pour a glass of sweating iced tea, and speak of the people who believe they are the heart of the world, even as their own hearts are hollowed out by the ghosts they call heritage.

## Chapter 3.1: The River-Folk - The Gilded Lie

*“Honor, my dear boy, is like a fine porcelain vase. It is a beautiful thing to display on the mantel, a testament to the quality of one’s breeding. It is also fragile, empty, and utterly useless in a flood. The trick is to convince everyone of its value, most especially yourself.”*
- **Final words of Lord Alistair Moreau to his heir.**

To understand the Sunken World, you must first understand the River-Folk. They are not merely the human baseline; they are the architects of the age, the authors of the Great Lie, and the most tragic victims of their own grand design. Their story is the story of the world in miniature: a magnificent, decaying edifice built over a foundation of anxiety and rot. They are the smiling, gracious hosts of a funeral party that has lasted for centuries, and they have long since forgotten who, or what, has died.

To play a member of the River-Folk is to engage in a constant, exhausting performance. It is to wrestle with a Chorus of socialites, politicians, and disgraced heroes, and to search for a sliver of your true self beneath a flawless, tattooed mask.

### The Gilded Façade: A Performance of Grace

In the eyes of the world, and most especially in their own, the River-Folk are the pinnacle of civilization. From the Gilded Families in their sprawling, vine-choked manors to the hard-working common folk in their dusty river towns, they project an image of effortless grace, unshakeable honor, and a deep, abiding connection to the world’s fading beauty.

Their culture is a slow, deliberate dance of etiquette and tradition. Language is a weapon, with a veiled insult carrying more weight than a drawn blade. A gesture, the choice of a flower for a lapel, the subtle bitterness in a toast—these are the currencies of power. They host lavish, languid garden parties on manicured lawns that seem to defy the encroaching swamp, their laughter tinkling like wind chimes, a sound as beautiful and hollow as their boasts.

This performance is most potent in their relationship with the Fading. The River-Folk have positioned themselves as the noble saviors of reality, the brave librarians preserving the world’s dying concepts. The practice of **Anchoring** is their most sacred art and their most profound act of public piety. A Gilded Lord will display the breathtaking tattoo of the Sunken Cathedral on his back, not as a mark of power, but as a "burden" he has taken on for the good of all. He will speak of the weight of this memory, the responsibility of carrying a piece of the world, and his guests will nod in solemn appreciation. They are the heroes in this story, the selfless martyrs holding back the grey tide of oblivion.

Their Heirlooms are the ultimate expression of this façade. The artistry of a River-Folk tattoo is unparalleled. A Myth-Weaver of this lineage is not a mere artisan; they are a master painter, a poet of the skin. Their needles trace lines of impossible fineness, their Marrow-Inks hold colors of heartbreaking vibrancy. A River-Folk Heirloom is a masterpiece, a seamless blend of mythic beasts, historical tableaus, and intricate family sigils that tell a glorious, carefully edited story of their bloodline.

### The Rot Beneath the Floorboards: A Culture of Anxiety

This entire performance is a lie. The Gilded Façade is a desperately constructed dam holding back a flood of existential terror. The truth of the River-Folk is not grace, but anxiety. It is a deep, pervasive fear of being forgotten, of becoming as faded and featureless as the lands that surround their opulent enclaves.

Their obsession with tradition is not born of respect for the past, but a terror of an uncertain future. Their rigid etiquette is not a sign of civility, but a desperate attempt to impose order on a chaotic, decaying world. And their practice of Anchoring is not an act of preservation, but one of ultimate, selfish consumption. They are not saving the world; they are devouring it, hoarding its last bits of beauty for themselves and leaving a grey husk for everyone else. They are vampires of reality, convincing themselves they are saints.

This deep-seated anxiety is reflected in their Chorus. While the Geodes hear a monolithic chant of duty and the Ash-Branded a scream of rage, the Chorus of a River-Folk is a chaotic, gossiping, and deeply dysfunctional family reunion. It is a cacophony of competing voices:

*   **The Matriarch:** The iron-willed grandmother whose voice is one of cold judgment and unyielding standards. She demands propriety, honor, and the ruthless maintenance of the family’s reputation.
*   **The Duellist:** The hot-headed uncle who died over a perceived slight. His voice is a whisper of paranoia and violence, urging you to see insults where none exist and to answer every challenge with overwhelming force.
*   **The Disgraced Poet:** The sensitive, melancholic cousin who drank himself to death. His voice is one of self-pity and romantic despair, finding tragedy in every small inconvenience and urging you toward grand, self-destructive gestures.
*   **The Scheming Politician:** The great-grandfather who built the family fortune on broken promises and backroom deals. His voice is a silken, manipulative murmur, advising you on how to lie, cheat, and turn every situation to your advantage.

To be a River-Folk is to host this mad tea party in your head, constantly trying to appease a dozen conflicting ghosts while maintaining a serene smile. This internal chaos often leads to the two great sins of their culture: a deep-seated hypocrisy and a casual cruelty born of profound insecurity.

### Society and Tradition: The Beautiful Cage

The life of a River-Folk is governed by a series of sacred, suffocating traditions that reinforce the Gilded Lie.

**The Debutante’s Inking:** A young Gilded scion’s entry into society is marked by their first major Heirloom tattoo. This is a grand affair, a party where a master Myth-Weaver publicly inks a piece of the family’s legacy onto the debutante’s skin. It is framed as a joyous occasion, the blossoming of a new generation. In truth, it is the moment the cage door swings shut, the moment the young person’s identity is formally subsumed by the weight of their lineage.

**The Veranda Confession:** In the sweltering evenings, it is a common ritual for family members to sit on the veranda, sipping iced drinks and speaking in low, confidential tones. This is where secrets are shared, alliances are forged, and resentments are allowed to fester. It is a performance of intimacy, where vulnerability is used as a weapon and every confidence is a potential piece of future blackmail.

**The Mourning Weave:** When a great figure dies, their most potent tattoo is sometimes ritually flayed and distilled into a unique batch of Marrow-Ink. A single, small tattoo—a "Mourning Weave"—is then inked onto their chosen heir using this essence. It is seen as the ultimate honor, a way of carrying a piece of the deceased with you. The grotesque reality is that it is a direct infusion of that ancestor’s ghost into the Chorus, ensuring their voice will be one of the loudest in the heir's head. It is a chain lovingly passed from one generation to the next.

**The Common Folk:** The non-Gilded River-Folk live in the shadow of this grand, decaying theatre. They are the audience, the stagehands, and often, the victims. They mimic the traditions of the Gilded in simpler, more earnest ways. They hold small family gatherings to celebrate a new, simple tattoo. They whisper their own secrets on their porches. They aspire to the perceived grace and power of the Gilded, often blind to the rot that lies beneath. This aspiration is their greatest tragedy, as they desperately strive to join a society that is actively poisoning the world they both inhabit.

### Playing a River-Folk Character

When you create a River-Folk character, you are creating a mask and the person trembling beneath it. The central question you must answer is: **Who are you when no one is watching?**

Your story is one of identity, of the struggle between your public persona and your private self. It is a story of wrestling with a legacy that is both a source of great power and a terrible, soul-crushing burden. Consider these archetypes as a starting point:

*   **The Gilded Scion:** You are the heir to a great and powerful family. Your life has been one of privilege, but also of immense pressure. Every action is scrutinized, every choice weighed against the history of your lineage. Do you embrace your destiny, becoming the next great leader of your family? Or do you chafe under the expectations, secretly yearning for a life of anonymity and freedom?

*   **The Disgrace:** You are a member of a Gilded Family who, through some scandal or failure, has been cast out. Your name is a curse, your Heirloom a mark of shame. Your journey is one of redemption or revenge. You might seek to restore your family’s honor, or you might burn the whole corrupt system to the ground. You have seen the ugly truth behind the Gilded Façade, and that knowledge is a dangerous weapon.

*   **The Upstart:** You were born a commoner, but through wit, ambition, or sheer luck, you have the opportunity to enter the world of the Gilded. You are a stranger in a strange land, trying to master the deadly game of high society. Do you try to remain true to your roots, or do you become colder and more ruthless than the nobles you once despised in your quest for power?

*   **The Keeper of Secrets:** You might be a loyal family servant, a canny Myth-Weaver, or a forgotten cousin. Your position has allowed you to see and hear everything. You know who is having an affair, who is poisoning their rivals, and what dark bargain the family patriarch made in the swamp a generation ago. Your power is not in your Heirloom, but in the secrets you hold. But knowledge is a heavy burden, and every secret has a price.

### River-Folk Traits

Your River-Folk character has the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. The River-Folk are defined by their force of personality and the varied demands of their complex lineages.

**Age.** River-Folk reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century, a lifespan that seems fleeting to the Cypress Kin and is a source of their deep-seated fear of being forgotten.

**Alignment.** The River-Folk’s obsession with tradition and order pushes them toward lawful alignments, while their inherent hypocrisy and self-interest often lead them toward neutrality or evil. A truly chaotic or good-hearted River-Folk is a rare and often rebellious figure.

**Size.** River-Folk vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Skill Versatility.** You gain proficiency in any two skills of your choice.

**The Chorus of Whispers.** The cacophony of your ancestors is a constant presence, offering a torrent of conflicting but occasionally useful advice. When you make an ability check, you can choose to open yourself to the Chorus. Roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
***The Chronicler's Price:*** When you use this feature, the Chronicler may introduce a narrative complication, representing the conflicting will of your ancestors. You might gain the information you seek, but also be struck by a pang of your grandfather’s crippling gambling addiction, forcing you to make a foolish wager. You might succeed on a Charisma check, but find yourself speaking with the arrogant, condescending tone of your great-aunt, offending a potential ally.

**Lineage.** The River-Folk are divided not by biology, but by the weight of their legacy. Choose one of the following lineages:

#### Gilded Scion
You were raised in a world of privilege, tutored in the fine arts of rhetoric, history, and the deadly dance of high society. Your family’s Heirlooms are a vibrant and potent testament to their power.

*   **Impeccable Breeding.** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient, you may add double your proficiency bonus to checks made with that skill.
*   **Anchored Knowledge.** You have spent your life surrounded by the Anchored memories of your family’s glory. You know the *Prestidigitation* cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

#### Dust-Born
You hail from the common folk, raised in the grey, Faded Lands. You have none of the Gilded’s airs, but you possess a grit and resilience they could never comprehend. Your legacy is not one of glory, but of survival.

*   **Hard-Won Resilience.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
*   **Legacy of Toil.** You gain proficiency with one artisan’s tool of your choice and with light armor.

The choice is yours. Will you be the Gilded Scion, fighting to uphold a beautiful lie, or the Dust-Born, struggling to survive in the shadow of its consequences? Either way, you are River-Folk. The blood of this anxious, arrogant, and beautifully damned people flows through your veins. The ghosts of your past are watching. Do try not to disappoint them.
