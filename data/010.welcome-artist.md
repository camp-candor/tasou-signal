Welcome, Artist.

You have read the history of our world—the grand, heroic lie of the Divine Artist and the Dreaming God, and the terrible, secret truth of the Primal Prisoner and the Gilded Cage. You understand that the ink in your skin is both your greatest weapon and your most intimate chain. Now, we must speak of the art itself. Not the history of it, but the practice of it. How do you play a game where the battlefield is your own body, the spellbook is your skin, and the cost of victory is yourself?

This chapter is your guide. Mythos Tattoo uses the framework of the world’s most popular roleplaying game, but the experience is fundamentally different. You are not just playing a character who happens to have magical tattoos. You are playing a living, breathing work of art. And like all great art, you are defined by your beauty, your meaning, and your inevitable decay. This is not a game about winning. It is a game about what you are willing to sacrifice for the story you leave behind.

### The Canvas: Your Character is a Masterpiece in Progress

In other worlds, a character is a collection of statistics, skills, and inventory. Here, your character is a canvas. Their story begins not with the circumstances of their birth, but with the first brushstroke of divine ink upon their soul: their Primal Mark. Everything else is built upon that foundation.

**The First Brushstroke: The Primal Mark**

During character creation, your choice of lineage (Scion of the Mountain-Shred, Child of the Star-Stained Sea, etc.) is more than just a set of racial traits. It is the core theme of your artwork. It is the medium in which your story will be told. Think of it as your artistic school. A Scion of the Mountain-Shred is a work of living sculpture, all hard lines, deep shadows, and unyielding form. A Child of the Star-Stained Sea is a bioluminescent watercolor, fluid, transparent, and shimmering with hidden light. A Kin of the Verdant Veins is a vibrant tapestry, a riot of life, growth, and the beautiful, brutal cycle of decay.

Your Primal Mark is not just a cosmetic detail; it is the source of your most profound conflict. It is the cage that defines you. When you roleplay, constantly consider your Mark. How does it feel on your skin? Does it pulse with a faint warmth? Does it grow cold when you are afraid? How does it influence your thoughts? A Scion is not just strong; they feel the slow, patient weight of the mountain in their soul, making them resistant to change. A Child of the Stars is not just clever; they feel the cold, infinite distance between celestial bodies, making true intimacy a challenge.

The Unmarked, in this context, are the most terrifying and thrilling canvas of all: they are blank. Their story has no pre-ordained theme. They are a work of charcoal on paper, capable of being anything, but also terrifyingly vulnerable, able to be smudged into nothingness at any moment.

**Adding to the Composition: New Tattoos as a Narrative Climax**

In many games, leveling up is a moment of mechanical progression. You gain a new spell, a new ability, and you move on. In Mythos Tattoo, gaining a new tattoo is a major life event, a narrative climax that should be roleplayed with the gravity it deserves. It is the moment you choose to add another, permanent line to your composition.

When your character has the means and the motivation to seek out a Myth-Weaver, it is a quest in itself. Finding an artist who can ink the specific myth you need is not a simple transaction. It is a pilgrimage. The process itself is a long, painful, and deeply spiritual ritual. As a player, you should think about this moment. Why this tattoo? What does it represent? What power do you hope to gain, and what are you afraid of losing to it?

Work with your Game Master to make this a scene. Describe the needle, made from a griffin’s talon or a shard of obsidian from a volcano’s heart. Describe the ink, a vibrant, living substance that smells of ozone and old blood. Describe the pain, and the strange, ecstatic feeling as the Ink-Echo awakens and bonds with your soul. Acquiring a new power should never be a footnote. It should be a scar, a memory, and a chapter in your story.

**The Language of the Skin: Describe Your Art**

Since your character *is* a work of art, you must be its most passionate descriptor. When you cast a spell, don't just say, "I cast Fireball." Say, "The roaring phoenix on my back flares to life, its wings of liquid fire beating against my skin. I thrust my palm forward, and a gout of flame, an echo of the tattoo’s power, erupts towards the enemy."

When you use an ability, describe how the ink responds. Does the tattooed chain on your Fighter’s arm writhe and coil as he prepares to strike? Does the intricate pattern of a key on your Rogue’s hand glow as she picks a lock? Does the weeping willow on your Cleric’s shoulder seem to shed tears of light as he casts a healing spell?

This is the primary way you play a game about artwork: you constantly and vividly bring the art to life through your descriptions. Your character sheet may say you have the *Shield* spell, but your character’s story says they have a tattoo of a stoic, ancestral guardian whose spectral form leaps from their skin to intercept a blow.

### The Medium: The Beautiful, Terrible Price of Ink

Art requires a medium, and the medium of this world is a parasitic, soul-consuming ink. The most crucial part of playing Mythos Tattoo is embracing its central, tragic mechanic: **The Price of the Echo.** Power is not free. Every time you channel the magic of the Wyrm’s prison, you pay a tax, and that tax is levied upon your very self. This is represented by two intertwined mechanics.

**The Palimpsest Curse: The Sacrifice of Memory**

Every time you gain a new magical tattoo or use a powerful magical ability for the first time, your Game Master will ask you to sacrifice a memory. This is the Palimpsest Curse. The Ink-Echo, to fuel its existence, consumes a piece of your past.

This is a collaborative storytelling mechanic. The GM might say, “The tattoo of the Iron Oak settles into your skin, granting you an unyielding constitution. To fuel it, the ink demands a memory of a time you felt safe. Tell us what you forget.” It is then your turn, as the player, to decide what is lost. Do you sacrifice the memory of your childhood home? The feeling of being held by your parents? That one night you and your companions felt truly at peace around a campfire?

The memory is now gone. You, the player, remember it. Your character does not. They might have a strange, hollow feeling, a sense of loss they can’t name. They might look at their best friend and feel a warmth, but not be able to recall the specific adventures that forged that bond. Their skin tells the story of their heroism, but their mind is a library with pages torn out.

Roleplaying this loss is key. It creates characters who are powerful but poignant, heroic but haunted. They fight for a future they may not remember the reasons for, protecting people whose names are beginning to fade from their minds.

**The Wyrm’s Echo: The Erosion of Self**

The second price is more subtle, but just as devastating. The Primal Mark on your skin is a fragment of a cage holding a chaos god, and that god is always whispering. The more you align with your Mark, the more you give in to the Wyrm’s Echo.

Mechanically, this can be represented by gaining new Personality Flaws, or by making Wisdom saving throws to resist acting on a primal, destructive impulse. When your Scion of the Mountain-Shred is faced with a diplomatic challenge, they might have to fight the urge to solve the problem by simply smashing the negotiating table. When your Kin of the Verdant Veins sees a wounded animal, they might feel a predatory urge to "complete the cycle" rather than to heal.

This is the path to tragic heroism. Your character, in their quest to become more powerful, becomes less *themselves*. They become a caricature of their own power, a vessel for a dead god’s instincts. The roleplaying challenge is to portray this internal struggle. Do you fight it? Do you embrace it, believing it is the only way to be strong enough to save the world? Does a part of you enjoy the simplicity of giving in to these primal urges?

These are the questions that elevate a character from a collection of abilities to a tragic, compelling work of art.

### The Gallery: A World Defined by Its Art

The theme of art as a beautiful prison extends to the entire world. As a player, your character is not an anomaly; they are a product of a society that is both obsessed with and terrified of its own skin.

**Reading the Canvases: Social Interaction**

When you meet an NPC, the first thing you should ask the GM is, "What are their tattoos?" The answer is a window into their soul, their history, and their secrets.

*   An old woman with a single, faded tattoo of a lullaby’s musical notes on her hand is not just an old woman. She is someone who sacrificed every other memory to hold onto that one, single piece of her past. There is a story there.
*   A king covered head-to-toe in symbols of justice, law, and order is not a righteous ruler. He is a man who has erased his own personality to become an automaton of his ideals. He has no capacity for mercy, only for the cold logic of his ink.
*   A villain who is Unmarked is terrifying, not because he is powerful, but because his motivations are entirely his own. He is unpredictable, a true agent of free will in a world of puppets. His actions are not dictated by a whispering god, which makes him far more dangerous.

Use this to your advantage. Your character, a living work of art, should be an expert at reading the art of others. A social encounter is a visit to a gallery, and your job is to interpret the meaning behind the paint.

**A Clash of Aesthetics: Combat and Conflict**

Combat in Mythos Tattoo should be described as a clash of living myths. When you fight, you are not just trading blows; you are pitting your art against your enemy’s.

Describe the way your tattoos flare and react. When a monster born of the Chaos Wastes attacks, describe how its form seems to glitch and shift, an unfinished, corrupted piece of art. When you face a Gilded noble, their attacks might be precise and elegant, but also rigid and predictable—the movements of a puppet on a string.

A fight between a character with a Phoenix tattoo and one with a Frost Wyrm tattoo is more than just fire versus ice. It’s a battle between the concepts of rebirth and stasis, passion and entropy. Frame your descriptions in these epic, thematic terms.

### The Artist and the Curator: Your Role at the Table

Finally, it is crucial to understand your role in this unique storytelling experience.

**For the Player: You are the Artist.**

Your primary job is to create a beautiful, compelling, and ultimately tragic work of art. Embrace the flaws of your character. Cherish their sacrifices. Your goal is not to accumulate the most power with the least cost; it is to tell the most meaningful story about the price of that power.

Every choice you make is a brushstroke. The memories you choose to sacrifice, the moments you give in to the Wyrm’s Echo, the way you describe your living tattoos—these are the skills of your craft. Do not be afraid to create a character who is broken, haunted, and flawed. In the world of Mythos Tattoo, those are the very qualities that make a work of art a masterpiece. The central question you should always be asking is not, "What do I gain?" but, "What am I willing to become?"

**For the Game Master: You are the Curator.**

Your role is to build the gallery in which these artworks reside. You present the world, you embody the other canvases (the NPCs), and you enforce the themes of the setting. Your most important tool is the Price of the Echo.

Do not use memory loss as a "gotcha" punishment. Use it as a story prompt. When a player sacrifices a memory, take note of it. Later, reintroduce the person or place from that memory. Let the player roleplay the heartbreaking awkwardness of staring at a childhood friend whose name they no longer know. Let the consequences of their sacrifices become future plot hooks.

You are the one who describes the way the Wyrm’s Echo manifests, tempting players with easy power at the cost of their agency. You are the one who populates the world with other walking, talking works of art, each with their own story and their own price.

Your job is not to defeat the players, but to curate an experience where their choices have weight and their sacrifices have meaning. You are the guardian of the world’s tragic, beautiful irony.

So, pick up your dice. They are your brushes. Choose your ink. And let us begin the work of creating a story that will be remembered, long after the artist who painted it has forgotten their own name.
