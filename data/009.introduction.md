Welcome, traveler, to the world of Mythos Tattoo.

Before you take your first breath here, before you choose your name or trace the lineage of your blood, you must first understand the skin you are in. Look down at your arm. There, shimmering with a faint inner light, is the ink that defines you. It is your Primal Mark, the tattoo you were born with, a sacred inheritance from the very dawn of time. To the uninitiated, it is art. To the wise, it is history. To the powerful, it is a weapon. To you, it is your soul made manifest.

In this world, we do not write our stories in dusty tomes or sing them in fleeting ballads. We etch them into the only canvas that truly matters: our flesh. The magic of this world is not found in the whispered words of wizards or the divine prayers of clerics; it is a living, breathing power that flows from the intricate designs that adorn our bodies. A warrior’s strength is not merely in his muscle but in the roaring visage of the alligator tattooed across his back. A sage’s wisdom is not a product of study alone but a gift from the celestial charts inked upon her skin. A king’s right to rule is not a matter of succession but is proclaimed by the glorious, sun-drenched tiger that covers his chest, a mark of power his family has borne for a thousand years.

We are the Children of the First Canvas, the inheritors of a world born from a divine dream. We are told that in the beginning, there was only the First Wyrm, a colossal, slumbering beast whose hide was the void itself. Upon this canvas, a being of infinite imagination, the Divine Artist, spent eons crafting our reality. With needles forged from dying stars and ink brewed from the blood of creation, the Artist tattooed the world into existence. The jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Tooth mountains were the Artist’s boldest scars. The shimmering, endless ocean was a wash of celestial blue, and the whispering forests were delicate, cross-hatched patterns of life.

The power of this creation was so immense, so vibrant, that the First Wyrm could not contain it. In a final, glorious act, its tattooed hide shattered in an event we call the Sundering. These fragments rained down, and from them, all life was born. We, the people of this world, are the living echoes of that divine art, each of us born with a Primal Mark, a sliver of the original creation myth that dictates our potential, our destiny, and our connection to the magic that saturates the air we breathe.

To be Unmarked, to be born a blank slate, is the greatest of curses. It is to be without a past, without a future, without a soul.

This is the sacred truth. It is the story that has been told for generations. It is the foundation of our civilization.

And it is a beautiful, tragic, and unforgivable lie.

### The Gilded Cage

The truth, the one buried so deep that its discovery would shatter the world anew, is a tale not of creation, but of imprisonment. The "First Wyrm" was no benevolent dreamer. It was a primal entity of pure, untamable chaos, a being of such destructive potential that it threatened to unmake reality itself. The "Divine Artist" was no creator. It was a Warden.

Unable to destroy this chaotic entity, the Warden devised the ultimate prison. It did not forge chains of metal, but of meaning. It did not build walls of stone, but of law. With its divine needles, it tattooed the very concept of order onto the prisoner's hide. The mountains were not a work of art; they were anchors. The oceans were not a splash of color; they were a pacifying ward. The constellations were not a map of the heavens; they were the intricate tumblers of a cosmic lock. The entire world was a cage, the most magnificent and complex prison ever conceived.

The Sundering was not an accident. It was a prison break.

The Primal Prisoner thrashed, shattering a part of its own tattooed skin, and in doing so, shattered a part of its cage. The fragments that fell were not seeds of life, but shards of a shackle, each one containing a microscopic fragment of the prisoner’s chaotic soul, eternally bound to the piece of the prison designed to contain it.

This is the true nature of the Primal Mark. It is not a gift of destiny, but the brand of a jailer. It is not a connection to a divine dream, but a fragment of a divine cage. The magic that flows from it is not the power of creation, but the leaking, radioactive energy of a contained cosmic horror.

And the most terrible irony of all? Every act of magic, every glorious tattoo sought for power and prestige, is an act of reinforcing the bars of this gilded cage. When you draw upon the might of your Primal Mark, you are not expressing yourself; you are performing maintenance on your own prison cell.

Welcome to Mythos Tattoo. Your body is a story, but you are not the author. Your power is immense, but your will is not your own. Your quest is not to fulfill your destiny, but to discover if you can ever truly escape it.

### The Price of the Echo

In this world, your power is a living thing. The ink in your skin is not a static pigment but a dormant, semi-sentient organism—an "Ink-Echo." When a tattoo is completed by a skilled Myth-Weaver, the Echo awakens, forming a symbiotic, and often parasitic, bond with its host. This bond is the source of your abilities, the conduit through which you channel the world’s tainted magic. But the Echo is hungry, and power always comes at a price. Every time you call upon the magic of your tattoos, you pay that price, drawn directly from the currency of your soul. This is a truth whispered in back alleys and screamed in the madhouses, a truth the powerful deny with every fiber of their being: the Price of the Echo.

There are two primary costs you will pay on your journey.

**The Palimpsest Curse:** The Ink-Echo sustains itself on your memories. To grant you power, it must consume a part of your past. The more potent the magic you wield, the more cherished the memory it demands as fuel. When your Barbarian, covered in the tattoos of the Raging Boar, enters a frenzy of untold strength to save his companions, he may find that when the bloodlust fades, he can no longer remember his mother’s face. When your Wizard, her arms a library of arcane runes, casts a spell that rewrites a sliver of reality, the ink may devour the memory of her first love, leaving only a cold, academic knowledge that it once existed.

Your skin becomes a beautiful palimpsest. It tells the story of your great deeds, but the pages of your mind, the ones that held the reasons *why* you did them, have been scraped clean to make room for the new text. The most powerful heroes in the land are often the most hollow, their minds a collection of glorious, empty battlefields, their hearts devoid of the personal connections that once set them on their path. As a player, you must ask yourself: What memories are you willing to sacrifice for power? What part of yourself are you willing to burn to keep others warm?

**The Wyrm’s Echo:** Your Primal Mark is not just a cage; it is a cage that still hums with the consciousness of the prisoner. The more tattoos you add that harmonize with your Mark, the louder that hum becomes. This is the Wyrm’s Echo, the gradual erosion of your personality as it is overwritten by the primal, alien instincts of the shattered chaos god.

A Scion of the Mountain-Shred, whose body is a masterpiece of stony sigils, does not just become strong and unyielding; he becomes emotionally inert, stubborn to the point of self-destruction, and prone to volcanic bursts of rage he cannot control. He is losing himself to the Wyrm’s instinct for stasis and territory. A Child of the Star-Stained Sea, adorned with glowing constellations, does not just gain flashes of insight; she becomes cold, detached, and begins to view people not as living beings, but as predictable data points in a cosmic equation. She is being consumed by the Wyrm’s alien, dispassionate intellect.

The greatest arch-mages and warriors are not masters of their own destiny; they are the most refined puppets, their actions and personalities almost entirely dictated by the nature of their ink. Their struggle is a constant, internal war against the very source of their strength. In your game, this might be represented by a Wisdom saving throw to resist a primal urge, or by gaining a new personality flaw every time you acquire a powerful new tattoo.

### The Canvas of a Broken World

The world of Mythos Tattoo is a land of stark contrasts, a tapestry woven from threads of breathtaking beauty and quiet horror. Civilized lands are vibrant, saturated with the magic siphoned by their inhabitants, while the spaces between are often muted, grey, and haunted by creatures born from the Wyrm’s nightmares.

**The Gilded Cities:** The centers of power are breathtaking. Towers of magically shaped stone are covered in glowing, protective wards. The nobility, known as the Gilded, are living works of art, their every movement a display of the power they wield. Yet, beneath this veneer of perfection lies a deep paranoia. The Gilded are terrified of the price of their power, constantly seeking alchemical remedies to preserve their fading memories and employing scribes to follow them, chronicling their lives so they have something to read when they forget who they are.

**The Myth-Weavers’ Guilds:** Tattoo artists are among the most revered and feared members of society. They are a blend of shaman, surgeon, and scholar. The most skilled Myth-Weavers can create tattoos that grant unimaginable power, but they are also gatekeepers of a dangerous truth. Most are ignorant tools of the system, believing the lies of creation. A rare few, the Heretical Weavers, have discovered the truth. They practice their art in secret, sometimes creating "flawed" tattoos designed to create loopholes in the prison, or desperately seeking a "Solvent Ink" that might be able to free a soul from its cage.

**The Chaos Wastes:** On the fringes of civilization lie the lands most scarred by the Sundering. Here, the laws of reality are thin. The landscape is surreal and ever-changing. This is the home of the Echoes—horrifying, ethereal monsters that are the psychic residue of the Primal Prisoner’s rage and pain. It is also, sometimes, the home of the Wildings: individuals whose Primal Marks were broken at birth, leaving them with a raw, untamed connection to the chaos. Most are driven mad by this power, but a few learn to control it, becoming terrifyingly powerful and utterly unpredictable.

### The Mark of Your Soul

In Mythos Tattoo, your choice of race is a choice of lineage, a choice of which fragment of the divine prison defines you. Your class is not a job you learn, but a reflection of how you have chosen to use, fight, or succumb to the power inked upon your skin.

**The Scions of the Mountain-Shred:** Descended from the Wyrm’s stony, mountainous plates, you were born with tattoos of jagged peaks and deep fissures. Your Primal Mark brands you as an anchor of reality. You are naturally strong and resilient, your skin often taking on a stony texture. Your magic is that of the earth, and your role is one of stability and defense. But the Wyrm’s Echo within you pushes you toward inertia and explosive rage. You might be a stoic Barbarian whose rages are tectonic events, a resolute Fighter who is an unmovable wall of defense, or a Forge Cleric whose connection to stone and metal is an art form.

**The Children of the Star-Stained Sea:** Your ancestors were formed from the Wyrm's underbelly, which was tattooed with the celestial ocean. Your Primal Mark is a swirl of nebulae and shimmering constellations, a brand that marks you as a manipulator of illusion and fate. Your magic is subtle and mind-bending, drawn from the cosmic currents that flow through your ink. The Wyrm’s Echo whispers to you of cold, hard truths, tempting you to see people as mere variables. You might be a Wizard who pulls spells from the patterns on your skin, a Trickster Rogue who weaves illusions as a second nature, or a Warlock whose patron is a sentient constellation whispering forbidden secrets.

**The Kin of the Verdant Veins:** Born from the Wyrm’s limbs, which were covered in tattoos of lush forests and winding rivers, your Primal Mark is an intricate pattern of leaves and flowing water. You are branded as a tender of the life that grows upon the prison’s walls. You are a natural healer and shapeshifter, but the Wyrm’s Echo within you is predatory, seeing all things as part of a brutal, unsentimental cycle of life, death, and rebirth. You could be a Circle of Spores Druid whose tattoos crawl with beautiful, deadly fungi, a Ranger whose bond with beasts is written on your very soul, or a Life Cleric who understands that to preserve life, one must sometimes cultivate death.

**The Unmarked:** You are the ultimate irony. You were born without a Primal Mark. Society sees you as a cursed, soulless outcast, a blank canvas in a world of masterpieces. The truth is you are the only one who is truly free. Your soul is not bound to a fragment of the prison. You cannot wield the innate magic of the tattooed, but you are also immune to the Palimpsest Curse and the Wyrm’s Echo. Your mind is entirely your own. Your journey is the most uncertain of all. Do you seek to gain a tattoo to fit into the world, thereby sacrificing your unique freedom? Or do you weaponize your blankness, becoming a revolutionary who sees the bars of the cage no one else does? You could be any class, your abilities learned through grit and determination rather than innate power: a cunning Rogue who exploits the flaws in a society built on lies, a determined Fighter who relies on pure skill, or even a Sorcerer who, through a freak accident, has found a way to tap into their own chaotic soul without the filter of a tattoo.

### Your Story, Written in Ink and Blood

The world of Mythos Tattoo is a stage for stories of profound personal struggle and epic consequence. The central question is not "Can you become powerful?" but "What will you sacrifice for it, and is it worth the price?"

A campaign could be a desperate search for the legendary "Pure Ink," the only substance rumored to create tattoos free from the Wyrm’s influence. It could be a political thriller, as the characters navigate the hollow, paranoid courts of the Gilded, where everyone is a puppet to the art on their skin. It could be a rebellion, a desperate fight led by the Unmarked to shatter the Great Deception and free a world that doesn't even know it's enslaved. Or it could be a deeply personal journey, the story of one hero fighting to hold onto their own identity as the magnificent, terrible power within them threatens to burn it all away.

So, look again at your skin. See the ink. It is beautiful. It is powerful. It is your key to glory and your chain to a forgotten god.

What will you do with it?
