From the Gilded Press, acclaimed creators of *The Umbral Heart* and *The Alchemist's Republic*, comes the definitive guide to a revolutionary style of play for the world of Mythos Tattoo. You’ve read the core truths of the world, of the Great Deception and the Gilded Cage. You understand that magic is a prison and memory is its price. But what if the greatest battles are not fought on blood-soaked fields, but in the silent, incense-filled studios of the master Myth-Weavers? What if the struggle is not for a throne, but for the very soul of art itself?

Welcome, honored Game Master, to **Playing a Fine Art Fantasy Campaign.**

This is not a supplement about adding more monsters or magical items. This is a guide to a fundamental shift in perspective. It is a treatise on running a campaign where the central conflicts revolve around the creation, critique, patronage, and profanation of the world’s most potent and personal art form: the living tattoo. Here, a perfectly executed line of ink can be more devastating than a sharpened sword, a patron’s scorn more terrifying than a dragon’s fire, and the quest for a rare pigment more perilous than any dungeon crawl.

In a Fine Art Fantasy campaign, the drama is intimate, the stakes are personal, and the horror is breathtakingly beautiful. It is a game for those who wish to explore the beautiful, terrible price of creation.

### Part 1: The Core Principles - The Aesthetics of Power

To run a campaign centered on fine art in Mythos Tattoo, you must embrace four core principles. These are the pillars that distinguish this style of play from a traditional adventure.

**Principle 1: Beauty is a Weapon, and a Shield**

In Mythos Tattoo, aesthetics are not subjective; they are a tangible force. The quality of a tattoo—its composition, its linework, its symbolic resonance—directly impacts its magical efficacy and, more importantly, its stability. A masterfully inked tattoo is not just more powerful; it is a more secure prison for the chaotic soul-fragment within, a stronger shield against the Wyrm’s Echo. A crude, hastily applied design is a cracked and leaking cage, prone to chaotic outbursts and rapid mental decay.

This principle makes the Myth-Weaver the most important artisan in the world. They are not just creating decoration; they are performing a form of soul-surgery with aesthetic precision.

*   **In Your Game:** Describe tattoos with the language of an art critic. A noble’s protective ward isn’t just a “+1 to AC”; it is “a perfectly balanced geometric lattice of silver ink, its lines so fine they seem to disappear when viewed from an angle, creating a profound sense of serene inviolability.” A back-alley thug’s strength-enhancing tattoo is “a brutish, asymmetrical scrawl of a snarling wolf, its proportions jarring and its ink thick and clotted, radiating a palpable sense of uncontrolled, painful rage.” The beauty or ugliness of the art has a direct, describable effect on the world.

**Principle 2: The Artist as Protagonist**

In traditional fantasy, artisans are often relegated to the role of NPCs who craft items for the "real" heroes. In a Fine Art Fantasy campaign, the artists *are* the heroes. A campaign might center entirely around a group of Myth-Weavers, their apprentices, and their patrons. Their challenges are not about slaying goblins, but about securing a rare pigment from a dangerous Chaos Waste, winning the patronage of a fickle Gilded noble, or engaging in a high-stakes “Ink Duel” with a rival artist to be named the city’s Weaver Laureate.

The Myth-Weaver’s studio is the dungeon, the blank skin of a client is the treasure chest, and the rival artist is the dragon.

*   **In Your Game:** The skills of creation are paramount. Persuasion, Insight, and Deception are vital for navigating the world of patrons and critics. Sleight of Hand and a deep knowledge of History or Arcana are the mechanics of the art itself. A player character might be a brilliant technical artist who lacks social grace, a charismatic hack who can sell mediocre work to the elite, or a revolutionary who seeks to create a new artistic movement that subverts the prison of the Primal Mark.

**Principle 3: The Tyranny of the Canvas**

The ultimate canvas in this world is living, feeling, and often unwilling flesh. This is the source of the setting’s deepest horror and most profound drama. Every masterpiece is also a scar. Every act of creation is an act of violation on some level. A patron might commission a tattoo, but it is their body that must endure the needle, their mind that will pay the Palimpsest Curse, their personality that will be eroded by the Wyrm’s Echo.

A Fine Art Fantasy campaign leans into this body horror, not for shock value, but for dramatic weight. The relationship between the artist, the client (the canvas), and the art itself is a complex triangle of trust, ambition, and sacrifice.

*   **In Your Game:** Explore the consequences of the art. A Myth-Weaver might be haunted by a past client who was driven mad by a tattoo that was “too perfect,” its Wyrm’s Echo too strong. A player character might be commissioned to create a magnificent tattoo on a young noble, knowing that the process will erase the child’s cherished memories of their deceased mother. The art is beautiful, but the cost is always visible, always personal. Is it ethical to create a masterpiece if it destroys the canvas it’s painted on?

**Principle 4: Patronage, Politics, and Prestige**

Art does not exist in a vacuum. It is funded by the rich, controlled by the powerful, and coveted by the ambitious. The world of high-end Myth-Weaving is a cutthroat political arena. Great houses define their legacy by the exclusive masters they retain. Wars are fought not over land, but over the secret formula for a rare, stable ink. An artist's reputation, their prestige, is their most valuable asset and their greatest vulnerability.

A campaign can be driven entirely by the social and political machinations of the art world. A positive review from a famed Gilded critic can make a career; a whispered accusation of using "Corrupted Ink" can end one.

*   **In Your Game:** Make patronage a central mechanic. Players may need to compete for the attention of a powerful noble to fund their next great work. This might involve navigating elaborate galas, creating smaller works to prove their worth, and sabotaging the efforts of their rivals. Introduce a "Prestige" score for the party or for individual characters, which grants them access to better resources, more influential clients, and more dangerous secrets.

### Part 2: The Players' Canvases - Character Creation for an Artful Game

To play in this style, characters must be deeply embedded in the world of art and its consequences. Encourage players to choose backgrounds and classes that reflect this focus.

**New Backgrounds:**

*   **Gilded Scion:** You are the child of a Gilded noble, raised in a world of serene beauty and hollow emotions. Your body may already be a canvas for a master’s work, a legacy you never chose. You are a patron, a critic, or a rebel fleeing the gilded cage. **Feature: Eye for Quality.** You can instantly appraise the quality and approximate value of a tattoo, and you know the names and reputations of the major Myth-Weavers in any civilized area.
*   **Myth-Weaver’s Apprentice:** You spent your youth cleaning needles, grinding pigments, and studying the forbidden lore of the Ink-Echos. You are either a journeyman artist seeking to make your own name or a runaway who knows the terrifying secrets of your former master. **Feature: Trade Secrets.** You have proficiency with Tattooist's Tools. You know the chemical compositions of common and uncommon inks and can identify the "signature" stylistic elements of a given Myth-Weaver's work.
*   **Unmarked Critic:** Born a blank slate, you have a unique and untainted perspective. While the tattooed see the world through the filter of their own ink, you see things as they are. You have made a name for yourself as a critic of art and culture, your words carrying weight precisely because you are an outsider. **Feature: The Unblemished Eye.** Your mind cannot be swayed by the innate magical influence of a tattoo. You are immune to magical effects that would charm or frighten you if they originate from a living tattoo.

**Reimagining Classes:**

*   **Bard (College of Criticism):** You are not a musician, but an arbiter of taste. Your instrument is your voice, and your songs are scathing critiques or soaring praises. You use your words to build up or destroy an artist’s reputation. Your Bardic Inspiration is a whispered insight that helps an artist achieve a breakthrough or a patron see the value in a work.
*   **Rogue (The Forger):** You are a master of imitation. You can perfectly replicate the style of a famous Myth-Weaver, a skill that is highly illegal and highly lucrative. You might be a con artist selling fakes to gullible nobles, or a spy using your skills to create tattooed disguises.
*   **Wizard (The Pigment Alchemist):** You have eschewed traditional magic to study the ultimate arcane substance: the living ink. Your spellbook is a formula book of rare pigments. You adventure to find exotic components—the powdered dust of a fallen star, the venom of a dream-serpent, the crystallized tear of a forgotten god—to create inks with unique magical properties.
*   **Cleric (Forge or Knowledge Domain):** You see the act of tattooing as a sacred rite, a way of bringing divine order to the chaos of the soul. You are a historian, a keeper of ancient and "pure" designs, fighting against the corruption of modern, decadent art forms.

### Part 3: The GM’s Palette - Running the Campaign

Running a Fine Art Fantasy campaign requires a shift in your GMing style, focusing more on social intrigue, detailed description, and personal horror.

**Mechanical Tools:**

*   **The Art of Creation (A Skill Challenge):** The creation of a significant tattoo should never be a simple roll. Treat it as a skill challenge. The lead Myth-Weaver must make a series of checks using their Tattooist's Tools, with the DC determined by the complexity of the design and the rarity of the ink. Other characters can assist with History checks (to recall the symbolic meaning of the design), Arcana checks (to stabilize the magical flow), or even Performance checks (to soothe the client during the painful process).
    *   **Success:** A masterpiece. The tattoo is stable, powerful, and beautiful, granting a minor boon and increasing the artist's Prestige.
    *   **Partial Success:** A competent but flawed work. The tattoo functions, but it might have a minor cosmetic flaw or a slightly unstable Wyrm’s Echo, leading to a new character flaw for the recipient.
    *   **Failure:** A disaster. The ink corrupts, the design is botched. The tattoo is unstable, granting a curse instead of a boon, and the artist’s reputation is shattered.

*   **Prestige & Notoriety:** Track this simple score (from 1 to 10). When the PCs create a successful work, win a competition, or gain a powerful patron, their Prestige increases. When they are associated with a failed work, are caught in a scandal, or anger a critic, it decreases. Their Prestige score determines who is willing to meet with them, what commissions they are offered, and how much they can charge for their work.

*   **Non-Combat Encounters:** Design your sessions around art-centric challenges.
    *   **The Gala:** A social encounter where the PCs must schmooze with potential patrons, gather rumors about their rivals, and avoid the verbal barbs of a powerful critic.
    *   **The Pigment Hunt:** An exploration encounter where the party must venture into a dangerous region to harvest a rare ingredient, facing environmental hazards and monsters drawn to the ingredient's magical aura.
    *   **The Ink Duel:** A formal competition between two Myth-Weavers. This is a series of contested skill checks, where each artist describes their technique and style, trying to win over a panel of judges.

**Narrative Tools:**

*   **Campaign Hooks:**
    *   **The Masterpiece:** A Gilded Lord announces a competition to find an artist worthy of creating his "Soul-Tattoo," a final work that will define his legacy. The prize is fame and fortune, but the Lord's current Myth-Weaver will do anything to stop a rival from replacing him.
    *   **The Forgery:** The PCs discover that a series of famous tattoos on several city leaders are actually flawless forgeries. The original tattoos, and their bearers, are missing. Who is replacing the city’s elite, and for what purpose?
    *   **The Fading Duke:** A beloved and powerful Duke is suffering from a virulent form of Ink Rot, his magnificent tattoos turning into cancerous, weeping sores. The PCs are hired to find a cure, a quest that will lead them to the legendary, mythical "Pure Ink."
    *   **The Patron’s Secret:** The PCs are hired by a mysterious, incredibly wealthy patron who provides them with unlimited resources on one condition: they must use their art to subtly embed a series of arcane symbols into the tattoos of the city's most powerful nobles. They have no idea what the symbols do, but their patron is paying too well to ask questions... for now.

### Part 4: The Masterpiece - A Story in Progress

A Fine Art Fantasy campaign is not about reaching the end of a dungeon. It is about the story that is told along the way, the beautiful scars earned, and the memories paid as a price for that beauty. It is a campaign that asks players to consider the nature of identity, the purpose of art, and the cost of a legacy.

You, the Game Master, are the Divine Artist in this story. The rules are your needles, the world is your ink. The player characters are your canvas, but they are not passive. They will struggle, they will create, they will bleed for their art. They will change the world not with the might of armies, but with the stroke of a needle, proving that the most powerful myth of all is the one you are willing to carve into your own soul.

What masterpiece will your players create? And what, in the end, will it cost them?
