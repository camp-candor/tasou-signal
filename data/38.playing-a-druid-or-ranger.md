Of course. Let us part the hanging moss and step off the beaten path, into the deep, quiet places where the world’s true, secret magic festers. It is not a magic of divine light or gilded lies, but of the rich, dark, and patient rot that will inevitably claim them all.

## Chapter 10: The Sermon of the Kudzu - Playing a Druid or Ranger

*“The Gilded Lord builds his manor of stone and carves his glorious lies upon it. He thinks it will last forever. He has never watched a kudzu vine devour a tombstone. The vine does not hate the stone. It does not fight the stone. It simply… grows over it. It is patient. It is hungry. And it knows, in its deep and silent way, that everything, in the end, is just something to climb. That is the only sermon worth hearing.”*
- **An old Loam-Keeper, to a young apprentice.**

In the sweltering, anxious theatre of the Sunken World, where the living are haunted by the dead in their blood, there is one power that is older, quieter, and infinitely more patient than any ancestor. It is the magic of the world itself, the deep, resonant power that the Gilded Families, in their perfumed terror, call "the Green Rot." To its practitioners, it is simply the **Loam-Whisper**.

This is the magic of Nature. But do not mistake it for the vibrant, life-affirming art of other realms. In a dying world, Nature is not the loving mother; she is the patient undertaker. Her magic is not the song of the blooming flower, but the slow, deliberate work of the root that shatters the coffin. It is the wisdom of the grave-soil, the relentless hunger of the vine, and the predatory stillness of the bog. To wield this magic is to become an agent of the world’s slow, inevitable, and beautiful decay.

To play a Druid or a Ranger in Mythos Tattoo is to turn your back on the grand, narcissistic opera of the bloodline and to attune your soul to this older, wilder Chorus. You are a Loam-Keeper or a Grave-Warden, and your story is not written in the ink of heroes, but in the mud, the moss, and the bone-deep memory of the world itself.

### The Loam-Whisper: The Chorus of the World’s Grave

The source of Nature magic is not a pantheon of gods or a single, heroic ancestor. Its Chorus is the land itself. The Sunken World is a dying organism, and its soil is a repository for every life it has ever hosted. The Loam-Whisper is the collective, decaying consciousness of every beast, every plant, every person that has ever lived, died, and rotted back into the earth.

It is a Chorus of compost. It does not speak in words, but in sensations, instincts, and the phantom echoes of a billion forgotten lives. When you listen, you hear:

*   The hiss of a primordial serpent that died in the mud a thousand years ago.
*   The deep, groaning memory of an ancient cypress tree that was petrified by a forgotten cataclysm.
*   The fleeting, terrified scent of the deer that was hunted and consumed on this spot last winter.
*   The cold, mineral taste of the Geode whose bones turned to iron ore in the heart of a hill.

To be a practitioner of this magic is to attune your Heirloom not to your blood, but to the blood of the world. You are a medium for the parliament of decay, a priest to a congregation of mulch.

---

### The Loam-Keeper: The Priest of the Cycle (Druid)

You are the philosopher of the Green Rot, a mystic who sees the sublime beauty in the cycle of decay and rebirth. You do not mourn the Fading; you see it as a necessary fallowing of the land, a quiet moment before the rot can truly begin its work of making the soil rich again. You are a Druid, and your magic is a sermon on the beauty of returning to the earth.

#### The Weave of Rot: A Grotesque and Organic Art
Your spellcasting is instinctual, guttural, and deeply connected to the physical world. It lacks the cold precision of the Gilded or the searing certainty of the Divine. It is the magic of the gut and the bone.

*   **Verbal Components** are not words, but mimicry: the clicks, hisses, and growls of the beasts whose echoes you channel; the groan of shifting earth; the rustle of dead leaves.
*   **Somatic Components** are slow, organic gestures that trace the chaotic, fractal patterns of your Heirloom, which resembles lichen, tree rings, or the veined tracery of a decaying leaf.
*   **Material Components** are potent, meaningful decay: mistletoe from a lightning-struck oak, bark from a tree growing from a great beast's grave, water from a bog where a titan is said to have fallen.

#### Wild Shape: The Great Beast’s Ghost
This is your most sacred and misunderstood art. You do not simply transform into an animal. You offer your body as a temporary vessel for the **Archetypal Echo** of that creature—the collective, ghostly memory of every wolf, every bear, every great cat that has ever lived and died in this land.

This transformation is a haunting, beautiful spectacle. Your form dissolves and reforms not into a perfect, living animal, but into a spectral replica woven from the very stuff of the swamp.
*   Your **Bear Form** might be a shambling creature of moss, mud, and tangled roots, with glowing fungi for eyes and a roar that sounds like cracking timber.
*   Your **Wolf Form** might seem to be made of shadow and mist, its paws making no sound, its howl the lonely sound of the wind through dead reeds.
*   Your **Giant Eagle Form** could be a terrifying thing of storm-tossed leaves and splintered branches, its cry the shriek of a breaking bough.
You are not a beast; you are the memory of a beast, a ghost of the wild made flesh, and this is why your attacks are considered magical.

#### Druid Circles: Philosophies of Decay
Your Druid Circle is your specific doctrine on the nature of the Green Rot, a mechanical and narrative path that defines your relationship with the Loam-Whisper.

*   **Circle of the Moon:** You are a master of transformation, a Loam-Keeper who believes that the self is an illusion and that true wisdom lies in wearing the ghostly masks of the ancient beasts. You are more comfortable as an echo of the wild than as a person, and you see your Wild Shape not as a tool, but as your truest form.
*   **Circle of Spores:** You are the most honest of all Druids. You do not hide behind the forms of great beasts; you embrace the rot in its purest form. You are a priest of the fungus, a tender of the grave-soil, a living monument to the beauty of decay. Your Symbiotic Entity feature is not a cloud of spores, but the visible manifestation of your own Dirge-Lichen Heirloom spreading across your body, a temporary surge in the Patient Rot that grants you terrible, beautiful power.
*   **Circle of the Shepherd:** You are a summoner of ghosts. Your "spirit totems" are not fey blessings, but temporary manifestations of the pack’s collective soul, visible only as faint, shimmering distortions in the air. You call upon the echo of the Great Wolf Pack to grant its predatory cunning, or the memory of the Ancient Elk Herd to grant its resilience. Your summoned creatures are Archetypal Echoes, beasts of mud and moonlight, just like your Wild Shape.
*   **Circle of Stars:** You are a heretic among your kind. You do not look down into the Loam-Whisper for power; you look up, believing the true life magic comes not from the world’s decaying past, but from the alien light of the stars. You are a practitioner of the Star-Strangle Heresy, and your fellow Loam-Keepers see you as a dangerous anomaly who has turned from the honest rot of the earth to embrace an alien, sterile beauty.

### The Grave-Warden: The Predator in the Cycle (Ranger)

If the Loam-Keeper is the priest, you are the grim, practical warden. You are a Ranger. You live on the border, the half-rotten fence between the Gilded Manors and the deep swamp. You do not preach the sermon of the kudzu; you are the vine itself, silent, watchful, and deadly. Your magic is not philosophical; it is the practical, predatory cunning of the wild, a set of instincts borrowed from the predatory ghosts of the Loam.

#### Magic as Instinct: A Hunter’s Repertoire
Your spells are not grand invocations, but practical tricks learned from a Chorus of hunters and survivors.

*   **Favored Enemy:** Your Favored Enemy feature is not a study of monster anatomy. It is an act of deep listening. To choose a favored enemy is to attune your soul to a specific frequency of the Loam-Whisper, to the collected memories of every creature that has ever hunted or been hunted by your quarry. You know how it thinks, how it moves, how it bleeds, because you have a thousand of its ancestral enemies whispering in your ear.
*   **Hunter's Mark:** Is the application of a **"Grave-Scent,"** a psychic trace of decay that you paint on your quarry’s soul, making them visible to your senses as a faint, sickly-sweet aura.
*   **Pass without Trace:** Is the art of mimicking the silence of a rotted log, of hushing your own life-beat to convince the Loam-Whisper that you are already part of its quiet, decaying embrace.
*   **Summon Beast:** Calls not a fey spirit, but a single, potent **"Hungry Ghost,"** the echo of a loyal hunting hound or a savage wolf from your own personal history or the land’s, bound to your will by a shared predatory instinct.

#### Ranger Archetypes: Methods of the Hunt
Your Ranger Archetype defines your role as an agent of the cycle.

*   **Hunter:** You are the ultimate pragmatist of the cycle. You embody the predatory logic of the Loam-Whisper in its purest form. Your abilities are not magic, but a set of grim, perfected techniques for killing. You are the wolf’s tooth, the hawk’s talon, the patient, deadly waiting of the spider.
*   **Beast Master:** You have formed a bond not with a living animal, but with a single, unusually powerful and coherent animal ghost. This **"Echo-Companion"** is your partner, a vestige of the wild that has chosen to tether itself to your soul. It might be the Archetypal Echo of your family's most loyal hunting dog, or the ghost of a great swamp cat that you defeated in a rite of passage. It is not entirely real, and when it is "killed," it does not die, but simply dissipates back into the Loam-Whisper, awaiting your call to coalesce once more. This bond is deeply personal, a friendship with a memory, and it is a source of both great strength and profound, unending sorrow.
*   **Gloom Stalker:** You are a warden of the darkest, most forgotten parts of the swamp, the places where the Fading is most complete and the Loam-Whisper is a maddening silence. You have learned to walk in the shadows of memory, to become a ghost yourself. Your magic is the uncanny silence of a forgotten grave, the terror of a predator that is no longer even a memory.

### The Feral Mind: The Price of the Green Rot

The Gilded Lord pays for his magic with his memories. The Sainted Paladin pays with his free will. The practitioner of Nature magic pays with their humanity. The more you listen to the Loam-Whisper, the more you begin to think like the Loam. This slow, creeping transformation of the soul is the **Feral Mind.**

*   **The Slowing of the Soul:** The Loam-Whisper is infinitely patient. It thinks in seasons, not in seconds. As you grow in power, the frantic, anxious concerns of mortal society begin to feel alien to you. The intrigues of a Gilded court, the urgency of a merchant’s deal, the very concept of being "on time"—these things start to seem absurd. You become slow to speak, slow to anger, your emotional landscape weathering and eroding like a stone.

*   **The Predatory Empathy:** You do not lose your empathy, but it becomes a strange and terrible thing. You cease to see the people around you as friends, allies, or enemies. You see them as fellow creatures in the great, beautiful, and brutal cycle of life and death. You might feel a profound sense of pity for the wounded deer, even as you slit its throat with practiced efficiency. You might love your companions deeply, in the way a wolf loves its pack, while also understanding, on a deep and instinctual level, that their bodies will one day make for excellent fertilizer. This is not cruelty; it is the cold, honest clarity of the wild.

*   **Harmonization with 5e:** A Chronicler can represent this through roleplaying and mechanics. A high-level Druid or Ranger might have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks to navigate a formal Gilded party, but gain advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Wisdom (Insight) checks to predict the actions of a cornered, frightened creature—be it a wolf or a desperate nobleman. The Chorus Strain for a Nature caster might not be a moment of madness, but a moment of unnerving, predatory calm in the face of horror, an alien reaction that unnerves their companions.

### Playing a Child of the Rot: Character Concepts

To choose the path of Nature magic is to choose to walk away from the grand, anxious theatre of the other Kin and to embrace a deeper, older truth.

*   **The Reclaimed Scion (Druid):** You were born Gilded, your skin marked for a glorious destiny of balls and backroom deals. But you fled the stifling, perfumed halls of your family’s manor. You found a strange peace in the honest rot of the swamp, and the Loam-Whisper spoke to you more truly than your own Chorus ever did. Now you are a refugee from a world of lies, seeking a more honest form of decay, but your old life, and the ghosts of your human blood, have not forgotten you.

*   **The Beast’s Ghost (Moon Druid/Beast Barbarian):** The echo of a single, powerful beast ancestor is the dominant voice in your Chorus. Perhaps you are an Ash-Branded whose lineage claims a primordial dire wolf, or a River-Folk whose great-grandfather was a legendary hunter who "went native." You are a berserker who rages not with human fury, but with the primal terror of a cornered animal. Your Wild Shape is not a choice; it is a surrender to this beast within, your human form a cage you are constantly trying to escape.

*   **The City Warden (Ranger):** You were born in the swamp but now find yourself in the Gilded City, a concrete and stone jungle that is just as savage as the one you left. You are a warden of this different kind of wilderness. You hunt the grotesque beasts that thrive in the city’s rotten underbelly—the Ink-Bled, the escaped Chimera Cult experiments, the desperate men who have become predators. You are a creature of the swamp, applying its predatory logic to survive in a jungle of stone and hypocrisy.

*   **The Heretic Gardener (Circle of Stars Druid):** You hear the Loam-Whisper, but you also hear the alien Star-Song. You believe the two are connected, that the alien life of the Star-Strangle is not a blight, but a new kind of seed for the world’s exhausted soil. You are a heretic to two different faiths, seeking to marry the beautiful, terrible rot of the past with the beautiful, terrible hope of an alien future, and both the Loam-Keepers and the Gilded Lords see you as a monster.

You have chosen the Green Rot. You have forsaken the ghosts of your own house to listen to the ghosts of the world. You are a creature of the mud and the moss, the vine and the bone. The others may see you as a savage, a hermit, a monster. Let them. They are the dying flowers in a porcelain vase. You are the rich, dark, and patient earth that will one day claim them all.
