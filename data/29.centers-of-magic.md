Of course. Let us now map the secret heart of the Sunken World. For while magic is in the blood, the blood is in the land, and there are places where the past bleeds through so thickly it stains the very air. These are not schools or academies where magic is learned, but wounds in the fabric of reality where it is simply, terribly, *felt*.

## Chapter 6: Resonant Loci - The Haunted Places of Power

Forget the gleaming towers of the archmage, the serene, ordered libraries of the scholar. Such places of clean, academic magic have no place in the Sunken World. Here, magic is not a science to be studied, but a fever to be caught. It is a thing of the blood and the bog, of memory and of mud. The centers of its power are not places of learning, but places of deep, terrible resonance.

These are the **Resonant Loci**, the points where the veil between the living world and the cacophonous, dreaming past is thin and torn. They are haunted places, saturated with the psychic residue of generations, where the Chorus of one’s own lineage is amplified to a deafening roar, and where the echoes of other, stranger histories bleed into the present.

A spellcaster does not go to a Locus to learn. They go to listen. They go to steep their soul in the raw, unfiltered essence of the past, to draw power from its sorrow, its rage, and its glory. But to stand in such a place is to risk being overwhelmed, to have one’s own quiet song drowned out by the opera of the dead. These are the centers of magic in Mythos Tattoo, and they are as much a source of madness as they are of might.

### The Sepulchers of Kin: Where Blood Runs Thickest

The most common and understood of the Loci are those tied to the great Kin-groups. These are the ancestral homelands, the sacred sites where a lineage’s Chorus is at its most potent and coherent. To a member of that Kin, to stand in their Sepulcher is to feel their Heirloom sing. To an outsider, it is to feel the crushing, xenophobic weight of a thousand dead eyes upon them.

#### The Gilded Mausoleum (River-Folk)

In the heart of the Gilded City stands a magnificent, white-marble edifice, its spires draped in flowering, funereal vines. This is the Gilded Mausoleum, the public face of the Sepulcher Lodge and the primary Locus of the River-Folk. It is a place of oppressive silence, the air cool and still, smelling of polished stone, old paper, and the dry, floral scent of funerary wreaths. The very walls seem to whisper with the carefully edited histories of the Gilded Families.

*   **Magical Properties:** Within the Mausoleum, the chaotic, gossiping Chorus of a River-Folk character is momentarily silenced, replaced by a clear, resonant litany of their "noblest" ancestors. This brings a sense of clarity and purpose.
    *   **Mechanics:** While within the Mausoleum, a River-Folk character has advantage on all Intelligence (History) checks related to their own lineage or the history of the Gilded Families. When casting a spell of the Divination or Enchantment school, they can roll their Chorus Strain die twice and take the higher result (making a strain less likely). Any non-River-Folk who attempts to cast a spell with a Verbal component must first succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, as the oppressive, judgmental silence of the place tries to choke their words.

*   **Guardians:** The Mausoleum is guarded by the **Curators** of the Sepulcher Lodge and their silent, tattooed enforcers. More dangerous, however, are the **Portrait Wraiths,** the actual spirits of the Gilded ancestors, who can step out of their oil-painted portraits to challenge those they deem unworthy of walking their halls.

*   **Adventure Hooks:**
    *   A player needs to access the secret genealogical archives in the Mausoleum’s vault to prove (or disprove) a claim to a noble title.
    *   A Gilded Lord has died, and his Mourning Weave must be created. The party is hired as security for the dangerous ritual, which must take place in the heart of the Locus.
    *   The ghost of a disgraced ancestor, whose portrait was removed from the walls centuries ago, begins to haunt the Mausoleum, demanding that the truth of their story be restored.

#### The Drowning Groves (Cypress Kin)

Deep in the most ancient part of the Murk, there are groves where the cypress trees are impossibly large, their roots forming vast, cathedral-like vaults above the black, still water. The air is cool and smells of wet earth and sweet rot. This is a Drowning Grove, the cradle and the tomb of the Cypress Kin. It is here that the Dirge-Lichen grows wild, its bio-luminescence casting the entire grove in a soft, eternal, emerald twilight. The silence here is not empty; it is a deep, resonant hum, the collective, sighing Murmur of the Elven race.

*   **Magical Properties:** A Cypress Kin standing in a Drowning Grove feels their own identity begin to gently dissolve, their mind merging with the great, silent consciousness of their people. This is both terrifying and profoundly peaceful.
    *   **Mechanics:** For a Cypress Kin, the Grove is a place of healing and rejuvenation. When they finish a short rest within a Grove, they regain one expended spell slot of a level equal to or less than half their proficiency bonus (rounded up). However, for each hour they spend within the Grove, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all Charisma checks for the next 24 hours, as their sense of self becomes blurred and indistinct. Spells of the Druid and Ranger list are cast here as if one level higher.

*   **Guardians:** The Groves are protected by the **Silent Ones,** the eldest Cypress Kin whose selves have been entirely consumed by the Murmur. They are living extensions of the swamp’s will. They are also guarded by ancient **Genius Loci,** the very spirits of the groves themselves, who may manifest as vast, mossy elementals or swarms of spectral fireflies.

*   **Adventure Hooks:**
    *   A player character’s Dirge-Lichen has become corrupted. The only cure is to graft a pure strain from a Drowning Grove, a place their people may have forbidden them to enter.
    *   A Gilded Anchor is attempting to siphon the essence of a Drowning Grove. The party must stop them before the Locus is rendered a Faded husk and the collective memory of the Cypress Kin is shattered.
    *   A scholar hires the party to guide them to a Grove, seeking to communicate with a Silent One to learn a secret from the world’s distant past.

#### The Quarry of Unbroken Oaths (Geodes)

The Great Quarries of the Geodes are more than mines; they are hollowed-out mountains, vast city-states of stone and resonance. The Quarry of Unbroken Oaths is the oldest and deepest of these. It is a place of endless, rhythmic noise—the distant, echoing clang of hammers, and the ever-present, bone-shaking vibration of the Monolithic Hum. The air is dry and tastes of dust and iron. The walls are not rough-hewn, but covered in a million overlapping Etchings, the oaths and grudges of a hundred generations carved into the living rock.

*   **Magical Properties:** The Monolithic Hum within the Quarry is so powerful it has a physical presence. It reinforces law, order, and principle to a terrifying degree.
    *   **Mechanics:** Any creature within the Quarry cannot willingly tell a lie or break a promise they make there. Attempting to do so requires a DC 17 Charisma saving throw; on a failure, the creature is physically unable to speak the lie or take the proscribed action. A Geode character who spends a long rest meditating on the Hum can choose to re-prepare all their spells, selecting from any spell on their class’s spell list (not just the ones they know), as the full, ordered knowledge of their lineage becomes clear to them. They forget these extra spells upon leaving the Quarry. Abjuration spells are cast here as if one level higher.

*   **Guardians:** The Quarry is protected by the **Hearth-Sworn,** the elite warriors of the Geode clans. Its deeper, more sacred chambers are guarded by **Oath-Forged Golems,** constructs of stone and iron animated by the sheer, binding power of ancient, unresolved grudges.

*   **Adventure Hooks:**
    *   A peace treaty must be signed between two warring families. The only place neither side will dare to break their word is in the heart of the Quarry, and the party must escort the delegates there.
    *   A player character is a "Flaw," a Geode who broke an oath. Their only path to redemption is to enter the Quarry and carve a Grudge-Stone against themselves, a ritual that may not be survivable.
    *   A powerful magical artifact is hidden in the Quarry, its lock a metaphysical one that can only be opened by a person who can tell a lie within its walls—an act that is supposedly impossible.

#### The Ashen Crucible (Ash-Branded)

In the center of the Ashen Plains, there is a vast, circular crater of fused, black glass, miles across. At its heart, a single, jagged peak of obsidian rises, wreathed in a perpetual, heatless fire of pure psychic rage. This is the Ashen Crucible, the epicenter of the cataclysm that destroyed the Ash-Branded ancestors. The air here is thin and hot, and it carries the constant, screaming echo of their ancient, glorious wars. This is not a place of quiet horror; it is a place of unending, operatic fury.

*   **Magical Properties:** To stand in the Crucible is to have your own Chorus’s Scream amplified a thousand-fold. It is a place of immense, volatile power, a forge for the soul.
    *   **Mechanics:** Any creature in the Crucible has resistance to fire damage but vulnerability to psychic damage. An Ash-Branded character can attempt to harness the overwhelming rage. Once per long rest, they can choose to automatically fail a saving throw against a Chorus Strain effect. If they do so, the spell they are casting is treated as if it were cast with a spell slot two levels higher than the one used. Any Wild Magic Surge table a Chronicler uses in this area should have its most destructive options amplified.

*   **Guardians:** The Crucible is guarded by the **Silent Brand** tribes, who see it as their most sacred duty to prevent outsiders from stirring the rage within. The Locus itself is home to **Rage-Wraiths,** the psychic echoes of the demigod ancestors, who manifest as swirling elementals of ash and fire.

*   **Adventure Hooks:**
    *   An Ash-Branded character’s Scream is becoming uncontrollable. Their only hope is to undergo a ritual of Caging in the Ashen Crucible, a process that requires them to face the spirit of their most powerful ancestor.
    *   A Chimera Cultist seeks to harvest the raw, chaotic energy of the Crucible to create a monstrous new Heirloom. The party must stop them before they unleash an echo of the ancient wars upon the world.
    *   A piece of a legendary weapon, forged by the ancestors, is said to lie at the heart of the obsidian peak. It can only be retrieved by a warrior who can prove themselves worthy by enduring the Crucible's undiluted rage.

### The Scar-Tissues of the World: Places of Shared Memory

Some Loci are not tied to a specific Kin, but to a great and terrible event that has scarred the world itself. These places have a chaotic, dissonant Chorus, open to any who are sensitive enough to listen.

#### The Weeping Boneyard

Just outside the Gilded City lies a vast, ancient cemetery, so old that its newer sections are built on top of the sunken, forgotten graves of the old. It is a sprawling, overgrown wilderness of weeping willows, crumbling mausoleums, and leaning headstones. It is perpetually damp, even in the driest summer, as if the land itself is weeping for the sheer weight of the sorrow it contains. This is the great public graveyard, and the Chorus here is a sad, confused, and endless chatter of a million ordinary, forgotten lives.

*   **Magical Properties:** This is the great Locus of Necromancy. The air is thick with the whispers of the recently and not-so-recently departed.
    *   **Mechanics:** While in the Boneyard, any spellcaster can add the *Speak with Dead* spell to their list of prepared spells (it counts as being on their class’s spell list). Any Necromancy spell cast here that creates undead has its duration doubled. However, anyone who finishes a long rest within the Boneyard must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by a short-term madness, as the endless, sorrowful chatter of the dead seeps into their dreams.

#### The Last Veranda

This Locus is not a grand landmark, but a small, heartbreaking anomaly. In the heart of a Faded swamp, miles from any city, stands a single, pristine white veranda, a fragment of a Gilded Manor that no longer exists. It is untouched by rot or the Fading, the paint still perfect, the rocking chairs still gently moving in a breeze that doesn't blow. It is the site of the Great Betrayal, a legendary act of treason that shattered the two most powerful Gilded Families centuries ago. The air here is perfumed with phantom jasmine, and if you listen closely, you can hear the tinkle of ghostly laughter and the whisper of secrets.

*   **Magical Properties:** This is a Locus of social magic, of lies and charm. The echo of the betrayal has permanently warped reality here.
    *   **Mechanics:** Any creature on the Veranda has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks but disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks. Spells of the Illusion and Enchantment schools cast on the Veranda have their spell save DCs increased by 2. However, any creature who benefits from a spell cast here must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are compelled to speak a single, damaging secret about themselves or an ally, as the treacherous magic of the place demands its price.

### The Sanctuaries of the Un-Inherited: The Heretical Loci

Finally, there are the strange, hidden places of power for those who operate outside the system of Heirlooms.

#### The Still-Grange

The secret monasteries of the Brotherhood of Unburdened Skin are the antithesis of a Locus. A Still-Grange is a place of profound, unsettling **silence**. It is not the silence of the swamp, which is full of life, nor the silence of the Mausoleum, which is full of judgment. It is the silence of a void. The leaders of the Brotherhood, the Still-Souls, have found or created places where the Chorus cannot reach, where the connection to the past is severed.

*   **Magical Properties:** A Still-Grange is a dead zone for Heirloom magic.
    *   **Mechanics:** Any attempt to cast a spell using an Heirloom (i.e., by any of the standard Kin) within a Still-Grange automatically fails, the spell slot consumed. The caster feels as if they have shouted into a sound-proofed room—their call to their ancestor simply vanishes. For Blank-Skins, Warlocks, and Sorcerers, however, this silence is a place of clarity. They have advantage on all saving throws made to maintain concentration while within a Still-Grange.

#### The Faded Spot

The most dangerous and unstable of all Loci. A Faded Spot is a place where the Fading is not a slow, creeping rot, but an active, cancerous process. It is a hole in the world. The landscape here is a shifting, grey, featureless soup where reality itself is coming unstitched. Sounds are distorted, distances are meaningless, and the air feels like static.

*   **Magical Properties:** This is the Locus of the Faded-Touched Sorcerers, a place of pure, terrifying chaos.
    *   **Mechanics:** Any spell cast within a Faded Spot, by any caster, automatically triggers a Wild Magic Surge. The Chronicler is encouraged to create a custom, more dangerous Surge table for these locations. Furthermore, any creature that finishes a long rest in a Faded Spot must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a part of them is permanently claimed by the Fading—they might lose the ability to see a certain color, forget the taste of a specific food, or have a cherished memory of their childhood turn to a grey, featureless blur.

These are the places of power. They are the wounds, the scars, and the secret hearts of the Sunken World. They offer great power, but they are not conquered. They are endured. They are the past, and in this world, there is nothing more dangerous. Go to them if you must. But do not expect to leave with your soul entirely your own.
