Of course. To be a vessel for the divine in a world that has forgotten its gods is the loneliest and most terrible of callings. Let us speak of the priest who has no church but his own skin, and the knight whose only sovereign is a ghost.

## Chapter 9: The Weight of the Halo - Playing a Cleric or Paladin

Listen, child. Put aside the stories you’ve heard of other worlds, of shining gods who answer prayers and of silver-armored knights who serve a golden throne. Our world is not so simple. Our gods have Faded, their names now just another verse in a song no one remembers. Our thrones are worm-eaten and draped in cobwebs. And yet… the Light remains.

It does not fall from the sky. It does not answer the prayers of the desperate. It rises, cold and pure and terrible, from the deepest and most honorable of graves. It is the magic of conviction, the power of a story told so many times it has become true.

To play a Cleric or a Paladin in Mythos Tattoo is to forsake the chaotic, gossiping Chorus of your lineage and to become a vessel for its singular, unbending will. You are not a medium for your family’s many ghosts; you are the chosen apostle of its **Saints**. You are the one who hears, not a cacophony, but a single, perfect, and tyrannical note of moral certainty. You are a Chorus-Keeper or an Oath-Sworn, and your life is no longer your own. It is a sermon, a crusade, a living testament to a virtue so pure it has become a monstrous and beautiful burden.

### The Shared Burden: A Vessel for the Saint

While other Marked individuals wrestle with a dysfunctional family of ghosts in their blood, you have been "blessed" with clarity. Your Primal Mark, your Heirloom, is dominated by the echo of one or more ancestors of such profound, unshakeable conviction that their soul-fragments have calcified into something more than a memory. They have become an ideal. A Saint.

This Saint is your power, your guide, and your jailer. Their will is the source of your magic, their story the text of your faith. You do not choose your alignment; you inherit it. You do not wrestle with morality; you channel a foregone conclusion. This makes you a figure of immense power and terrifying certainty in a world drowning in grey ambiguity. But it is a lonely path. While others are haunted by a crowd, you are haunted by a god of your own making, and its expectations are absolute.

Clerics and Paladins are two sides of this same gilded coin. They are both **Vessels** for the Saints of their bloodline. The difference lies in their method. The Chorus-Keeper listens to the sermon. The Oath-Sworn *becomes* the sermon, written in blood and steel.

### The Chorus-Keeper: A Priest to a Congregation of Ghosts

You are the medium, the confessor, the spiritual anchor of your lineage. You are a Cleric. Your role is not to lead armies, but to listen to the quiet, insistent will of the Saints and to interpret their sermons for the living. You are the keeper of the family’s soul, and your own soul is the price of admission.

#### The Seance of the Self: Spellcasting as a Cleric
Your magic is an act of communion. You are the priest, and the ghosts of your blood are your congregation, your choir, and your god.

*   **Preparing Spells:** This is your morning prayer. You do not beseech a distant deity. You sit in quiet contemplation, your hands tracing the lines of your Heirloom, and you attune your spirit to the Saints you wish to keep close. You are choosing your sermon for the day. Will you listen to Grandmother Elara, the Healer, and prepare your healing spells? Or will you attune to Judge Alistair, the Lawgiver, and prepare your spells of binding and command? Your list of prepared spells is your chosen cabinet of spectral advisors.

*   **Spell Slots as Ancestral Attunement:** Each spell slot is a measure of your spiritual endurance, your capacity to safely channel the dead. When you cast a spell, you are opening a door and allowing a Saint to speak or act through you. The higher the spell’s level, the more of your own will you must cede to let their power flow. A 1st-level slot is a brief whisper of their will; a 9th-level slot is to have your soul become a cathedral for the full, resonant thunder of their conviction.

#### Divine Domains: The Virtues of the Blood
Your Cleric Domain is not a portfolio granted by a god. It is the dominant, inherited virtue of your family’s Saints, a moral legacy so powerful it has become a form of magic.

*   **Life Domain:** You are the scion of Healers. Your Chorus is dominated by the echoes of selfless compassion. Your Saints were the battlefield medics, the tireless midwives, the grandmothers who sat vigil through plagues. Your healing is a transference of their remembered sacrifice, and when you Weave it, you feel the phantom ache of their weariness.

*   **Light Domain:** You are the heir to Zealots. Your Chorus is a single, blinding glare of righteous fury. Your Saints were the crusaders who purged the family’s enemies, the priests who saw the world in stark black and white. Your magic is a searing, judgmental fire, the Saint’s Glare made manifest, and it burns not with heat, but with the cold fire of absolute certainty.

*   **Order Domain:** You are the descendant of Lawgivers. Your Chorus is a perfect, resonant harmony of unbreakable oaths and cold, immutable justice. Your Saints were the judges, the matriarchs, and the contract-signers who built your family’s power on a foundation of unbending rules. Your magic binds, commands, and enforces the ancient law of your lineage.

*   **Grave Domain:** You are the keeper of your family’s final rest. Your lineage is one of ancient morticians, tomb-wardens, and those tasked with appeasing the dead. Your Saints did not rage or heal; they brought a quiet, solemn peace. Your magic is that of the threshold, the gentle but absolute finality of the grave. You do not command the undead; you silence them, enforcing the sanctity of their rest.

#### Channel Divinity: The Saint Made Manifest
This is your most profound and dangerous art. When you use Channel Divinity, you are not just channeling a Saint’s power; you are stepping aside and allowing them to act *through* you. For a brief, terrifying moment, you are a passenger in your own body.

*   **Turn Undead:** You present your family’s holy symbol—a signet ring, a locket, a piece of your Heirloom itself—and it is not your voice that speaks, but the pure, unblemished voice of a Saint from your blood. The power that erupts is not just radiant energy; it is the sheer, overwhelming force of a pure soul’s conviction. Lesser undead, creatures of rot and regret, are not just frightened; they are existentially shamed by this purity, and they flee from it as darkness flees from a flame.

### The Oath-Sworn: A Crusader for a Single, Perfect Ghost

You are not the listener; you are the weapon. You are a Paladin. You have chosen a single, dominant Saint from your lineage and have sworn a magical, binding Oath to become their living will. You do not interpret the sermon; you are the mailed fist that delivers it. Your conviction is not your own; it is a perfect, borrowed fire, and you will use it to burn away the world’s impurities, starting with yourself.

#### The Indelible Vow: The Paladin’s Oath
Your Oath is not a promise to a concept; it is a spiritual contract with your most powerful ancestor. It is the act of handing the reins of your soul to a ghost you have chosen to call master. To break your Oath is the ultimate betrayal, an act that will turn your own power, your own Saint, against you in a blaze of self-destructive fury.

*   **Sacred Oaths as Ancestral Pacts:**
    *   **Oath of Devotion:** You have sworn yourself to a single, beatified ancestor—a noble founder, a beloved matriarch, a heroic knight. Your tenets are their literal, historical words. Your quest is to live as a perfect, unwavering imitation of their legend.
    *   **Oath of Vengeance:** You have bound your soul to an ancestor who was wronged, murdered, or betrayed. Your Saint is a ghost screaming for justice, and you are its blade. Your every action is dictated by the singular, burning need to settle a debt of blood that may be centuries old.
    *   **Oath of Redemption:** You have made a pact with a heretic, an ancestor who was unjustly cast out or disgraced by your own family. Your crusade is against your own kin, to clear your Saint’s name and to redeem a truth that your lineage has tried to bury.

#### The Fire of Legacy: Paladin Features as Ancestral Power
Every one of your abilities is a manifestation of your Saint’s will, made real through your sacrifice.

*   **Lay on Hands:** You do not channel a generic pool of healing. Your "pool of hit points" is the collected vitality of your lineage, which your Saint has granted you the authority to dispense. When you lay your hands on a wounded ally, you are bestowing upon them the remembered health of your ancestors, a transference that leaves you feeling a little older, a little more weary.

*   **Divine Smite:** This is the Saint’s Glare, focused to a razor’s edge. When you strike, you are not just hitting with steel; you are hitting your enemy with the full, concentrated moral judgment of the ghost in your blood. The burst of radiant damage is the sound of their perfect, unwavering conviction made manifest. It is the ultimate declaration that your cause is *right*, and your enemy is *wrong*, a truth so potent it tears them apart.

*   **Auras:** Your auras of Courage and Protection are the palpable, supernatural presence of your Saint. The air around you thickens with their conviction, their sheer force of will becoming a tangible shield that bolsters your allies and unnerves your foes. To stand near you is to stand in the shadow of a legend, and to be judged by its light.

### The Tyranny of the Light: The Burden of Being a Vessel

The Divine Light is a powerful ally, but it is a terrible master. The Weary Truth knows that no power is without its price, and the price of certainty is one of the highest.

#### The Prison of Purity
The Saints are not kind, and they are not flexible. They are absolutes. To be their Vessel is to be held to an impossible, inhuman standard.

*   **The Constant Judgment:** The Saint in your Chorus is always watching. Every choice is weighed against their perfect, unbending code. A Chorus-Keeper of the Order Domain who breaks a minor law to achieve a greater good might find their spells faltering, their connection to the Lawgiver ancestor fraying. An Oath-Sworn of Devotion who shows a moment of fear might feel a cold wave of disappointment from their heroic Saint, imposing disadvantage on their next attack. This constant, internal scrutiny is exhausting, forcing a character into a state of perpetual moral anxiety.

*   **The Saint’s Glare:** The greatest danger of the Light is its lack of nuance. It is a blinding fire that burns away all shades of grey. A Vessel can easily become a fanatic, their ancestor’s ancient prejudices and rigid dogma becoming their own. They can become so convinced of their own righteousness that they are blind to the harm they cause. A Paladin of Vengeance, driven by their murdered ancestor, might see every slight as a mortal insult, their quest for justice becoming a bloody, paranoid rampage. They are the most likely to be certain they are the hero, even as they become the monster.

#### The Martyr's Itch and the Lawgiver's Hand
Each type of Saint imposes its own unique psychological burden.
*   **The Martyr's Itch:** Those who channel Martyrs feel a constant, subconscious pull toward glorious, self-destructive sacrifice. They are the ones who will always volunteer to hold the line, to drink the poison, to take the bullet. It is a form of inherited suicidal ideation, dressed in the beautiful robes of heroism.
*   **The Lawgiver's Hand:** Those who channel Lawgivers are plagued by a need for order. They are compelled to correct every injustice, to enforce every rule, no matter how petty. They are the ones who will interrupt a desperate flight to write a citation for a poorly parked cart, because the law is the law, and their ancestor will give them no peace until it is upheld.

### Playing a Keeper of the Light: The Saint and the Sinner

To play a Cleric or a Paladin in Mythos Tattoo is to be a battleground. Your soul is the field upon which your own flawed, human desires wrestle with the perfect, tyrannical virtue of your Saint.

*   **The Last True Believer:** You are a Fool, in the most beautiful and tragic sense. You believe utterly in the righteousness of your Saint. You see their voice not as a burden, but as a blessing. Your story is about what happens when your perfect, black-and-white faith collides with the messy, grey reality of the Sunken World. Will your faith break, or will you break the world to fit it?

*   **The Burdened Heir:** You did not choose this path. The voice of the Saint in your blood was simply too loud to ignore. You wield its power reluctantly, constantly chafing against its rigid demands. You are a good person trapped in the service of a perfect ideal, and you are terrified of the day you will be forced to choose between your conscience and your power.

*   **The Redeemer:** Your lineage is one of villains, but a single, forgotten Saint lies buried in your Chorus. You have chosen to channel this one good ancestor, to become their vessel, in a desperate attempt to atone for the sins of your blood. You are a beacon of light born from a legacy of darkness, and the other, more monstrous voices in your Chorus are constantly trying to snuff you out.

*   **The Heretic:** You serve your Saint, but you have begun to question their dogma. You have seen that their ancient, perfect laws do not always lead to justice, that their righteous fury is often just cruelty. You are on a dangerous path, trying to reinterpret, to modernize, to find the spirit of your Saint's law rather than its literal, uncompromising word. To your fellow believers, this makes you a heretic, and to the Saint in your blood, it may make you an enemy.

You are a Vessel. Your body is a church, your skin a stained-glass window telling the story of its one, perfect Saint. You are the moral compass of a world that has lost its way. But every compass is just a needle, trapped in a box, forever pointing in a single, unchangeable direction. Pray that direction is true. And pray that you do not forget the feeling of what it was to be lost.
