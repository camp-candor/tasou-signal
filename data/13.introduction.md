Welcome, friend. Settle yourself down. The air hangs thick tonight, don’t it? Heavy with the scent of swamp magnolia and the slow, sweet rot of a world that’s been dying since the day it was born. Out there, in the gloaming, you can hear the cicadas thrumming their one ceaseless, feverish note. They’re singing a dirge for the sun, for the past, for all the beautiful things that are fading from this world like breath on a cold mirror. They call this place the Sunken World. A fitting name. Everything here is sinking—the land into the bog, the truth into legend, and memory into the very skin of our people.

You’ve come seeking stories. You’ve come seeking power. Here, they are one and the same. And they are paid for in blood, in ink, and in pieces of the soul you thought was your own. You see, in the Sunken World, history isn’t written in dusty tomes, and power isn’t held in crowns or scepters. It’s worn. It’s carried. It is etched into our very flesh in the form of the Mythos Tattoos, the living legacies we call Heirlooms.

This book is your needle and your inkpot. It holds the rules for playing a tabletop role-playing game in a world of sweltering heat, faded glory, and grotesque secrets. It is a game of Southern Gothic fantasy, where the greatest monsters are not the things that crawl from the swamp, but the ancestors whispering from within your own veins. You and your friends will take on the roles of the Marked, individuals bound by fate and ink to a past that is never, ever dead. One of you will serve as the Chronicler, the guide and final arbiter of this beautiful, decaying world.

So, pour yourself a glass of whatever poison stills the shaking in your hands. Let the drone of the cicadas settle into your bones. It’s time to talk about the ink.

### The Great, Tragic Lie: The Nature of the Heirloom

The story they tell in the Gilded Manors, beneath the slow-turning fans that stir the stale, perfumed air, is a lie. They say that in the beginning, the Progenitor Leviathan, the First Wyrm, dreamt the world into being. The laws of reality, the turn of the seasons, the very concepts of love and despair—they were all magnificent, shimmering tattoos upon its endless hide. When its dream grew too powerful, the Leviathan shattered, and from its inked fragments, all life was born, each creature carrying a Primal Mark, a sliver of the divine dream, a birthright of power.

It's a fine story. A noble one. It is also a comforting fiction whispered to keep the darkness at bay.

The truth is far more sinister. The tattoos are not a gift; they are a prison. The magic is not a birthright; it is a burden. And every ancestor whose strength you call upon is another ghost rattling the bars of your own gilded cage.

In the Sunken World, the ink is a living, symbiotic substance known as **Marrow-Ink**. It is harvested from the deep, silent places of the world: the crystallized blood of slumbering titans entombed beneath the earth, the phosphorescent fungi that feed on the memories of a forgotten age, the distilled sorrow of a battlefield where a thousand souls expired at once. This ink is not a passive pigment; it is a hungry medium.

When a person is tattooed by a master Myth-Weaver, they are not just receiving a piece of art. They are being infused with the memories, skills, and the very soul-fragments of their ancestors. This is the Heirloom. A warrior who has the "Grave-Oak Sigil" of her great-grandmother, a legendary shieldmaiden, tattooed upon her back doesn’t just gain a symbol of strength; she gains her ancestor’s uncanny ability to predict a foe’s strike, her resilience, her unyielding courage. In moments of dire need, she can call upon the "Chorus," the collective voices of her lineage, and let her great-grandmother’s spirit guide her arm.

This is the source of all power. A Myth-Weaver can shape the future by understanding the past. A Chimera Cultist can become a monster by inking a tapestry of warring bloodlines onto their skin. A Scion of the Mountain-Shred can move the earth because their great-great-grandfather was a giant who slept beneath it.

But the past is a jealous ghost. It does not give its gifts for free. This is the terrible irony of the Heirloom. The more you draw upon its power, the more of yourself you cede to the Chorus. That warrior with the Grave-Oak Sigil? When she lets her ancestor take control, her own memories of the battle grow hazy. She might find herself speaking in her great-grandmother’s dialect, or feeling a pang of sorrow for a long-dead rival she never knew. Her personality begins to erode, her identity becoming a palimpsest written over by generations of the dead. The greatest heroes of the Sunken World, their bodies magnificent canvases of their lineage’s glory, are often hollow shells, their own stories forgotten, replaced by the epic sagas etched into their skin. They are puppets dancing to the strings of ghosts.

### The Fading: A World Losing its Color

This inner decay is mirrored by the world itself. The Sunken World is dying a slow, quiet death known as the Fading. The vibrancy is leaching out of reality. The sky is a little paler each year, the taste of fruit a little duller, the passions of the heart a little cooler. Ancient histories blur, songs lose their melody, and the edges of creation are fraying like old cloth.

The Gilded Families, the aristocracy who rule from their crumbling, vine-choked estates, believe they are the bulwarks against this entropy. They practice the art of Anchoring, a form of tattooing where they seek to preserve a piece of the world by inking it onto their flesh. A noble lord might have a tattoo of a legendary waterfall, its waters forever shimmering on his chest. He believes he has saved it. The tragic irony is that he has stolen it. The act of Anchoring siphons the very essence of a thing out of the world and into the ink. The real waterfall still stands, but its roar is now a whisper. Its beauty is a memory. The tattoo is a glorious tombstone for a piece of the world.

The more the Gilded tattoo themselves with the wonders of the dying age, the faster the world around them turns to grey. They live in opulent, vibrant prisons of their own making, while the common folk toil in the ever-expanding Faded Lands, a world of muted colors and forgotten flavors. This is the central conflict of the Sunken World: a desperate, beautiful, and ultimately self-destructive struggle to hold onto a past that is slipping through everyone’s fingers, all while that very struggle accelerates the decay.

### Your Place in this Damned World

So, where do you fit into this tapestry of sorrow and ink? As a player character in Mythos Tattoo, you are one of the Marked. You are not a pristine hero setting out on a grand adventure. You are a soul burdened by a legacy you did not choose, gifted with a power that comes at the price of your own identity. Your story is not about saving the world in a grand, epic fashion. It is about navigating a web of secrets, wrestling with the ghosts of your own bloodline, and trying to carve out a life in a world that is actively forgetting how to live.

You might be:

*   **A Chorus-Keeper of the Bayou,** a re-flavored Cleric whose divine power comes not from a god, but from the collective whispers of your ancestors. You heal by sharing their resilience and curse your enemies with their dying regrets. But every prayer brings the risk of one of them speaking through you, taking control for a moment, an hour, a day.

*   **A Secret-Eater from the Gilded City,** a Rogue who bears the tattoos of forgotten spies and assassins. You can walk unseen and unheard, your skills a gift from the dead. But your Heirloom feeds on secrets, forcing you to pry into the lives of others while it slowly consumes your own memories, replacing them with the thrilling, paranoid recollections of your forebears.

*   **A Pact-Sworn Brawler,** a Fighter or Barbarian whose body is a canvas of their warrior lineage. Your fighting style is not your own; it is the muscle memory of a dozen different ancestors. When you enter a rage, it is not your fury, but the bloodlust of a long-dead berserker, and you must fight to retain control lest you wake up surrounded by a carnage you don’t remember committing.

*   **A Myth-Weaver,** a wizardly Tattoo Artist who understands the deep grammar of the Marrow-Ink. You can create tattoos for others, a dangerous and sacred act. You know the secrets of the Gilded Families because you have inked their lies onto their skin. You can even experiment with forbidden designs, attempting to create new destinies, but you risk creating monstrous, corrupted Heirlooms that consume their bearers entirely.

*   **A Blank-Skin,** the ultimate outcast. You were born without a Primal Mark, without a connection to the Chorus. The world sees you as a hollow man, a soulless creature without a past or a future. But you are also the only truly free person in the Sunken World. Your mind is your own. Your destiny is unwritten. You are a terrifying anomaly, a blank page in a world where every story has already been told. Do you desperately seek an artist to graft a lineage onto you so you can finally belong? Or do you embrace your terrifying freedom and challenge the very foundation of this ink-bound society?

Your party will be a motley collection of such souls, drawn together by circumstance or by the tangled threads of your shared histories. You will delve into flooded antebellum manors haunted by Ink-Bled horrors—creatures whose Heirlooms have consumed them entirely. You will navigate the treacherous social landscape of the Gilded Families, where a whispered insult can be more deadly than a blade. You will journey into the Faded Lands, seeking a fragment of reality pure enough to distill into new ink. You will uncover the sins of your ancestors and be forced to decide whether to atone for them or to embrace their dark legacy.

### To the Chronicler

If you have taken on the role of the Chronicler, you are the keeper of the Sunken World’s secrets. You are the voice of the sweltering heat, the whispering swamp, and the ghosts of the past. Your task is to bring this world of faded grandeur and grotesque beauty to life.

This is not a game of high adventure and clear-cut morality. It is a game of atmosphere, mystery, and personal horror. Dangle the secrets of your players’ Heirlooms before them. Let the ghost of a character’s grandfather, a notorious cheat, offer them advantage on a roll at the cost of a small betrayal. Have a rival Gilded Family’s history, tattooed on the back of their patriarch, reveal a truth that could shatter a player’s entire understanding of their own lineage.

Embrace the grotesque. Describe the way a corrupted tattoo writhes on the skin of an Ink-Bled monster. Let the players feel the oppressive humidity, hear the groan of rotting floorboards, and taste the cloying sweetness of the jasmine that covers a forgotten tomb. The world itself is a character, and it is a character that is sick, tired, and full of sorrow.

Your stories should focus on the deeply personal. The goal isn’t to find a legendary sword to slay a dragon. It is to find the lost grave of a great-great-aunt to appease her restless spirit, which has been causing a player’s healing tattoos to inflict wounds instead. The stakes are not the fate of the cosmos, but the fate of a character's own soul as it battles for purchase against the rising tide of its own history.

This is a world of slow burns and sudden violence, of quiet desperation and loud, operatic tragedy. It is a world where every choice is a compromise, and every victory leaves a scar—or worse, a beautiful, terrible new tattoo.

So, welcome to the Sunken World. The air is thick, the secrets are deep, and the ghosts are waiting. Your skin is a canvas, your blood is the medium, and your legacy is a story that has already been written. The only question is whether you will have the strength to write the final chapter yourself.

What will you etch upon your soul? And what price will you pay when the ink demands its due? Let’s find out.
