Of course. Let us sit a spell and talk about the different ways a soul can bleed. For in the Sunken World, magic is not a single, unified craft, but a collection of desperate philosophies, warring traditions, and damnable heresies. These are the great Camps of Magic, the factions of the soul that define not just how a person Weaves a spell, but *why*. Each is a different answer to the same terrible question: in a world that is dying, what is the proper relationship with the dead?

## Chapter 5: Camps of Magic - A Sermon on Scars

Do not be fooled by the Myth-Weaver who calls himself a Wizard, or the Story-Spinner who names herself a Bard. These are mere professions, the paint on the rotting façade. The true nature of a spellcaster is defined by their philosophy, their *Camp*. This is the fundamental belief that governs their relationship with their Heirloom, their Chorus, and the very nature of power itself.

To choose a Camp is to choose your tragedy. It is to decide which kind of ghost story you wish to live. Will you be a curator in a beautiful tomb, a monster stitched together from stolen glories, a thief of reality itself, a heretic who seeks the terrifying freedom of a blank page, or an anomaly who draws power not from the past, but from the world’s bleeding wounds?

Your choice will define your journey, your allies, your enemies, and the very texture of your soul. Choose wisely. The ghosts are always listening.

### 1. The Sepulcher School: The Art of the Perfect Tomb

**Philosophy:** *“The past is a flawless, finished work of art. Our duty is not to change it, but to preserve its beauty and honor its rigid, perfect lines. The self is fleeting; the lineage is eternal.”*

**The Doctrine:** The Sepulcher School is the establishment, the orthodox faith of the Gilded Families and the bedrock of their power. Its practitioners see the Heirloom not as a source of personal power, but as a sacred duty. They are the curators of their own bloodline, their bodies the sepulchers—the magnificent, ornate tombs—in which their ancestors’ legacies are interred. Their magic is an act of reverence. They seek to perfectly replicate the skills and powers of the ancestors, without deviation or innovation. Purity of lineage is their highest virtue, and the clean, unbroken story of their Heirloom is the ultimate measure of their worth. They are the Gilded Lie made manifest, believing that by encasing the past in the amber of tradition, they can protect it from the Fading.

**Methodology:** The magic of the Sepulcher School is meticulous, refined, and deeply conservative. A Myth-Weaver of this school (a classic **Wizard**) spends decades studying the genealogies of their family, learning the precise, ancestral patterns that will channel a specific echo with the least possible spiritual "noise." Their spellbooks are immaculate records, as much a history text as a grimoire. Their spellcasting is formal and ritualistic, each component a carefully rehearsed homage. They view the Chorus Strain not as a risk to be managed, but as a sign of personal imperfection, a failure to properly honor the dead. They seek to silence the chaotic gossip of their Chorus, allowing only the purest, most noble voices to speak.

**Views on Other Camps:**
*   **The Chimera Cult:** Vile butchers. They are grave-robbers who stitch together stolen corpses and call it a person, creating a cacophony that insults the very concept of lineage.
*   **The Anchors:** A necessary, if distasteful, tool. They admire the Anchors' dedication to preservation but find their methods shamefully direct and lacking in the proper reverence for history.
*   **The Kindred of the Blank Canvas:** The ultimate horror. To erase an Heirloom is an act of deicide, a patricidal madness that seeks to murder one's own history. A Blank-Skin is a walking blasphemy.
*   **The Un-Inherited:** Tragic, soulless orphans. They are to be pitied for their lack of a past and feared for the unpredictable nature of the strange powers they court.

**Character Concepts:**
*   **The Gilded Heir (Wizard/Paladin of the Crown):** You are the scion of a great family, your body a masterpiece, your destiny to lead. Your conflict comes from the crushing weight of perfection and the slow discovery of the hypocrisy that underpins your entire world.
*   **The Keeper of Oaths (Cleric of Order/Ancestral Guardian Barbarian):** Your power comes from the most lawful and resolute of your ancestors. You are a living bastion of your family’s traditions, but your rigidity makes you brittle in a world that demands compromise.
*   **The Family Duellist (Swashbuckler Rogue/Battle Master Fighter):** You channel the martial prowess of your lineage’s greatest warriors, your fighting style a beautiful, deadly, and unchanging dance passed down through generations.

### 2. The Chimera Cult: The Gumbo Pot of the Soul

**Philosophy:** *“A pure bloodline is a stagnant pond. A single story, told over and over until it has no meaning. True power is a gumbo pot. You take the best parts of every story, the strength of the wolf, the cunning of the serpent, the fury of the dragon, and you stir. The result is a monster, yes. But it is a monster that can survive anything.”*

**The Doctrine:** The Chimera Cult is the great heresy of the Sunken World. Its followers see the Sepulcher School’s obsession with purity as a suicidal weakness. In a dying world, they argue, adaptation is the only path to survival. They believe that a single lineage is a prison of limited potential. True strength lies in hybridization. Cultists actively seek out the Heirlooms of other Kin, other bloodlines—even of monstrous creatures—and graft them onto their own souls. They are spiritual surgeons and arcane biologists, creating a Chorus of warring, unrelated ghosts within themselves. Their goal is not to preserve a single story, but to become a living library of a thousand stories, and to wield the chaotic, unpredictable power that such a cacophony unleashes.

**Methodology:** The magic of the Chimera Cult is raw, visceral, and terrifyingly unstable. Their Myth-Weavers, often called **"Flesh-Stitchers,"** practice forbidden rituals, using alien inks and often flaying the skin-scrolls from the dead to graft a foreign legacy onto a new host. The result is a Chorus in a state of constant civil war. An Ash-Branded berserker screams alongside a Gilded diplomat, while the silent, predatory instinct of a swamp beast lurks beneath them both. This makes a Cultist’s magic incredibly versatile and powerful, but also makes them profoundly unstable. The Chorus Strain for a Cultist is a constant and severe threat, with partial possessions and bouts of madness being a common price for their power. Mechanically, **multiclassing** is the ultimate expression of the Chimera Cult’s philosophy.

**Views on Other Camps:**
*   **The Sepulcher School:** Cowardly, inbred fools polishing the bars of their own cages. Their obsession with the past blinds them to the future.
*   **The Anchors:** Amateurs. They steal the skin of the world, but the Cult steals the soul itself. A more worthy, if still misguided, rival.
*   **The Kindred of the Blank Canvas:** Insane. To seek emptiness when the world is full of power to be taken is the logic of a madman.
*   **The Un-Inherited:** Potential ingredients. A Warlock’s pact or a Sorcerer’s chaotic energy is just another potent flavor to be added to the gumbo pot.

**Character Concepts:**
*   **The Ambitious Outcast (Multiclass Character):** You were born into a minor lineage and crave the power to make your mark on the world. You have sought out the Chimera Cult to steal the strength you were not given by birth.
*   **The Monster at War (Path of the Beast Barbarian/Circle of Spores Druid):** Your body is a canvas of monstrous, warring Heirlooms. You physically manifest the traits of different ancestors—claws from one, a hardened shell from another. Your struggle is to keep the beast within from consuming you entirely.
*   **The Failed Experiment (Aberrant Mind Sorcerer):** You were the subject of a Flesh-Stitcher’s ritual that went horribly wrong. Your Chorus is not just warring; it is broken, a shattered mirror of a dozen different souls. Your magic is potent, but it is not your own, and it is driving you insane.

### 3. The Anchors: The Reality Thieves

**Philosophy:** *“The past is a corpse. The future is a ghost. Only the present is real. And the present is Fading. We do not mourn it. We consume it. We will be the last vibrant thing in a world of grey, and that will be our victory.”*

**The Doctrine:** A secret, nihilistic, and incredibly powerful philosophy practiced by the most elite of the Gilded Families, the Anchors are the true villains of the Fading. They have seen the truth: that honoring the past will not save them, and the future holds only oblivion. Their solution is one of utter, hedonistic selfishness. Their magic, **Anchoring**, is not about communing with the dead, but about preying on the living. They do not channel echoes; they extract essence. Using incredibly costly and complex rituals, they siphon the very concept of a thing—the vibrant red of a specific rose, the triumphant melody of a songbird, the feeling of a perfect summer afternoon—out of the world and ink it into their skin. They are not preserving reality; they are hoarding it.

**Methodology:** Anchoring is a form of high-level ritual magic that is beyond the reach of most. It requires unique and priceless inks and the focus of multiple casters. An Anchored tattoo is a wonder to behold—it is not a picture of a thing, but the thing itself. A tattoo of a flame will flicker and give off real heat. A tattoo of a songbird will actually sing. The Anchor gains a measure of the stolen concept’s power, but more importantly, they experience its beauty in a world that is increasingly devoid of it. Their manors and their very bodies are oases of vibrancy in the spreading desert of the Fading, and they guard their stolen reality with a paranoid, vicious jealousy.

**Views on Other Camps:**
*   **The Sepulcher School:** Sentimental fools. They are the useful, public face of preservation that allows the Anchors to conduct their theft in secret.
*   **The Chimera Cult:** Impatient savages. They mix the mud of the past, while the Anchors drink the wine of the present.
*   **The Kindred of the Blank Canvas:** An irrelevance. What is the point of a blank canvas in a world with no paint left?
*   **The Un-Inherited:** Curiosities. Their strange, external powers might be a new vintage to be bottled and consumed.

**Character Concepts:** The Anchors are almost exclusively villains. Player characters are more likely to be their victims or their enemies.
*   **The Stolen Voice (Bard):** You were a great singer, but a Gilded Anchor stole the essence of your voice, leaving you unable to perform. Your quest is to reclaim your stolen talent, even if it means destroying the Lord who carries it on his skin.
*   **The Grey Hunter (Ranger):** Your entire ancestral forest was rendered a Faded husk by an Anchoring ritual. You are the last survivor, your own Heirloom a pale, dying echo. You hunt the Anchors, a ghost of vengeance from the grey lands they have created.

### 4. The Kindred of the Blank Canvas: The Heresy of Self

**Philosophy:** *“You call your Heirloom a legacy. I call it a chain. You call your Chorus a source of power. I call it a crowd of ghosts that has stolen your name. You seek to perfect your tattoo. I seek to perfect the empty skin beneath. For only on a blank canvas can a person truly draw themselves.”*

**The Doctrine:** The most radical and heretical of all the camps, the Kindred of the Blank Canvas see the Heirloom not as a gift or a tool, but as the fundamental curse of their world. They believe that the Chorus is a psychic parasite that devours the self, and that true freedom, true identity, can only be found by erasing it. Their members are a strange mix: Blank-Skins who have embraced their "emptiness" as a form of purity, and Marked individuals who seek to be "cured" of their own history. Their ultimate goal is **"The Un-Weaving,"** a painful and perilous process to destroy one’s own Heirloom and silence the Chorus forever.

**Methodology:** The "magic" of the Kindred is a form of anti-magic. Their leaders, called **"Still-Souls"** or **"Un-Weavers,"** use alchemical solvents, ritual scarification, and a deep, meditative self-discipline (**Monk** abilities are a perfect representation) to battle their own Heirlooms. The process is an ordeal. To destroy a tattoo is to release that ancestor’s power in a violent, uncontrolled burst. To succeed is to be left psychically scarred and magically neutered, but also, in their eyes, to be finally, truly free. They are a secret society of spiritual ascetics and revolutionaries, hunted by the Gilded Families who see their philosophy as a threat to the very structure of reality.

**Views on Other Camps:**
*   **The Sepulcher School:** The willing prisoners, the wardens of their own gilded cages.
*   **The Chimera Cult:** Madmen who, finding their cage too small, have invited a dozen other prisoners to share it with them.
*   **The Anchors:** The most tragic of all, for they destroy the world outside to decorate a prison they do not even realize they are in.
*   **The Un-Inherited:** The closest thing they have to allies. The Un-Inherited, particularly the Blank-Skins among them, are living proof of their philosophy: that a soul does not need a past to have a future.

**Character Concepts:**
*   **The Apostate (Monk/Redemption Paladin):** You were born Gilded but have turned your back on your heritage. You seek out the Kindred to be Un-Woven, a journey of stripping away your power and privilege to find the person you were meant to be.
*   **The Blank-Skin Missionary (Rogue/Bard):** You are a true believer, an agent of the Kindred who infiltrates Gilded society, not to steal gold, but to steal souls—whispering the heresy of self to those who are beginning to crack under the pressure of their lineage.
*   **The Scarred Survivor:** You are a Marked individual who survived a botched Un-Weaving. Your Heirloom is shattered, a broken mosaic of scars and faded ink. Your magic is gone, but you are not entirely free. The ghosts are still there, wounded and enraged. You are now caught between the world of the Marked and the Kindred, belonging to neither.

### 5. The Un-Inherited: The Power from Beyond

**Philosophy:** *“The past is a swamp that seeks to drown you. Do not listen to its whispers. There are other voices, in other waters. Older voices. Stranger voices. They offer a different kind of power, for a different, and perhaps more honest, price.”*

**The Doctrine:** This is less a single camp and more a collection of anomalies who have found power outside the traditional system of Heirlooms. They are the Un-Inherited. They do not draw magic from the dead in their blood, but from the strange, living forces that still exist in the cracks of the dying world. They are a profound challenge to the other camps, for they prove that the past is not the only source of power.

**Methodology:** Their methods are twofold, and they map perfectly to the most alien of 5e’s spellcasting classes.

*   **The Pact-Bound (Warlock):** Most often a Blank-Skin, a Pact-Bound individual has made a deliberate trade. To escape the silence of their own soullessness, or to avoid the cacophony of a traditional Chorus, they have sworn themselves to a single, powerful, external entity. Their Patron might be a **Bayou Leviathan** (The Fathomless), one of the grotesque, primordial swamp-things that slept through the world’s creation. It might be a **Gilded Archfey**, a Cypress Kin so ancient it has become a genius loci of its grove. It could even be the collective, sorrowful consciousness of a **Faded Land** itself (The Undead or The Undying). Their power is a loan, their servitude a different kind of cage, but one with only a single, knowable warden.

*   **The Faded-Touched (Sorcerer):** The rarest and most feared of all. A Faded-Touched individual’s power comes not from an ancestor or a patron, but from a random, cancerous mutation of the soul. They are a living conduit for the Great Fading itself. The raw, chaotic entropy of the dying world flows through them. Their magic is not an echo of the past, but the scream of the present as it unravels. A **Wild Magic Surge** is not a cute, unpredictable quirk; it is a terrifying, localized manifestation of the Fading, a moment where reality thins around the caster. A **Divine Soul Sorcerer** might be a soul so pure it reflects the last, dying light of the world, their magic a beautiful, tragic, and ultimately doomed defiance of the coming grey.

**Views on Other Camps:** The Un-Inherited are individualists. They view the other camps with a mixture of pity, contempt, and morbid curiosity. They see the frantic scrabbling over lineage and legacy as a pointless argument in a house that is already on fire. They have found a different door out, even if that door leads to a stranger, and perhaps even darker, room.

Choose your philosophy. Choose your poison. Choose your ghosts. For in the Sunken World, you are the story you tell with your scars. Make it a memorable one.
