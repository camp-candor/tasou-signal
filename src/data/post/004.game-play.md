Clock keeping track of time <br>
Another second hits <br> 
App takes a reading of blockchain stamp  <br>
Code waits for unique number <br>
The newest section of laughter begins  <br>
The three movement beats incoming from the Natural Light Gummy <br>
Two movement beats prints onto memory due to Navigator Gummy  <br>
Blumenstein Gummy hits the scene with five bolds beats of movement  <br>
Nefarious Mauve Gummy waits to bank the moments into a secret vault which now finds itself filled <br>
The props that come in during this time are of a peachy nature <br>
Penalty of yellow on Blumenstein Gummy  <br>
All the other beats are green lit <br>
