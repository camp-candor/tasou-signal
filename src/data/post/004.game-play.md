Clock keeping track of time
Another second hits
App takes a reading of blockchain stamp 
Code waits for unique number
The newest section of laughter begins 
The three movement beats incoming from the Natural Light Gummy
Two movement beats prints onto memory curtsy of Navigator Gummy 
Blumenstein Gummy hits the scene with five bolds beats of movement 
Nefarious Mauve Gummy waits to bank the moments into a secret vault which now finds itself filled
The props that come in during this time are of a peachy nature
Penalty of yellow on Blumenstein Gummy 
All the other beats are green lit
